The interdisciplinary character of the continuum mechanics is emphasized and ample attention is given to applications that will appeal to a wide audience of physicists, mathematicians and engineers. More specifically, the following objectives are pursued: To provide the student with insight from first principles into the physical phenomena that belong to the domain of the mechanics of continuous media. Provide the student with a modern mathematical framework that makes an integrated study of continuous media possible. Making the student think interdisciplinary by making clear the common principles and the common mathematical framework in the different subdisciplines. Providing the student with techniques (approximate or numerical) with which physical problems in the continuum mechanics can be solved, with or without the help of the computer. To provide the student with the necessary basic knowledge, skills and mathematical attitudes that enable him / her to start a more advanced study in each of the subdisciplines discussed.\n",

This domain covers a wide range of applications, ranging from classic solids, semiconductors and surface physics to advanced functionalized materials with specific applications such as biosensors. Theoretical modeling provides tools to map the nature and intensity of the different interactions that occur at the nanoscale. This course builds on theoretical concepts from quantum mechanics, statistical physics and atomic and molecular physics to teach such simulation techniques.

In most of the optimization issues with which one is confronted, the search space is not convex and, in addition, the number of possible candidate solutions is much too large to exhaust them all in search of an optimal solution. That is why we rely on methods that quickly converge to solutions that, although sub-optimal, are still very good.

In the course various heuristic local search strategies are discussed that prove exceptionally successful in some of the most difficult problems in practice.\n",

Students will be taught how to apply a methodical way of designing a product, which should lead to enhanced product quality. By creating several possible solutions to a problem the chance to find the optimal solution is enlarged. All parts of the methodical design process will be practiced as group assignments (groups of 5 to 6 students). Since group work is very important part of product development, this will also be taught and practiced. In addition, lectures will be given on aspects of intellectual property rights (patenting), quality assessment and assurance, patient safety regulations, business development, green product developments. Lectures will also include presentations and testimonies from biomedical engineers in SME startup companies.\n",

      "Within this course the students go through the complete workflow starting from the creation of a 3D model of a blood vessel geometry based on patient-specific medical images (MRI, CT ...) to the computer simulation of the flow field in this model. We use a clinically relevant case as an example, eg calculating the flow field in the aorta of a patient with a cardiovascular pathology. The final goal is to learn how to calculate and interpret the flow field in patient-specific vascular models. These are skills and knowledge that can be transferred to other engineering disciplines where computational fluid dynamics (CFD) plays an important role, for example aerospace engineering. Basic data that is typically left are medical images (eg DICOM). Students then go through the following workflow: (i) Teaching image segmentation techniques; (ii) Generating a computational mesh (tetrahedron, hexahedron meshes) for the flow domain; (iii) Learn how to implement a CFD problem in adapted software: determining and implementing the boundary conditions, rheological properties of blood ...; (iv) Solving the numerical problem in CFD software; (v) Processing and interpreting the results. This project-oriented course can be included as a single course as well as within the package of courses consisting of &quot;Computational Fluid Dynamics&quot; and &quot;Computational Biomechanics&quot;.\n",

      "A report from the World Health Organization in 2006 shows that neurological disorders cause up to 6.3% of the global burden of disease. This report estimates that the number of healthy life years lost as a result of neurological disorders will increase from 92 million in 2005 to 103 million in 2030. This increase of around 12% is mainly due to the aging of the population. Notwithstanding the limited number of therapeutic successes, therefore, much importance is still attached to neuroscientific research of the brain both under normal and pathological conditions. Mainly the translational objectives are a driving force for investments in neuroscientific research. Translational neurosciences are defined as: 1 Experimental non-human and non-clinical (basic scientific) studies 1 performed with the specific intention to discover the mechanisms, biomarkers, 1 pathogenesis or treatments for disorders of the nervous system; 2 Clinical studies that provide a basis for the development and testing of 1 new therapeutic strategies for people with disorders of the 1 nervous system. In other words, the translational neurosciences transfer pre-clinical basic knowledge to clinical practice and thereby expand the understanding of brain structure, function and disease, and translate this knowledge into clinical applications and new therapies of disorders of the nervous system. Translational neuroscience includes the process of using all available technological advances to develop new therapies with measurable results for patients with neurological disorders. In this course the emphasis will be on translational neuroimaging, where multiple imaging techniques are used to bridge the gap between preclinical research and clinic practice. These imaging techniques must meet certain criteria such as being non-invasive (MRI), or at least minimally invasive (PET) and must also provide quantitative information that simplifies the translation process from pre-clinical findings to clinical application.\n",

Secondly, the trend is towards a performance-oriented structural design in which the overall structural response is studied, taking into account a natural fire course including cooling phase.

This will involve estimating the temperatures in building compartments and the temperatures that individual structural members get exposed to as a function of time. Fundamentals of the behaviour of common construction materials and estimation of the variation of mechanical properties of construction materials affected by fire (i.e. temperature rise). Structural analysis principles are then applied to the fire problem. Simple methods to carryout calculations to determine structural behaviour in the event of a fire will be presented followed by an introduction to advanced analytical and computational tools for analysing structural behaviour in fire.

This course presents mathematical optimization as a flexible methodology that extends the students' problem-solving abilities. Students are taught how to translate (real-life) problems of substantial complexity into formal mathematical optimization problems. Moreover, students will learn how 'to select, apply and/or create efficient optimization procedures to solve these optimization problems efficiently. The general philosophy behind this course is application-oriented. Driven by a variety of applications in bioengineering (including but not limited to bioinformatics), several theoretical concepts on mathematical optimization will be introduced and studied up to a level that allows these concepts to be applicable in practice. Consequently, the main focus will be on the application and implementation (in a programming language) of these concepts.\n",

Throughout the lectures, several applications of bioinformatics are touched upon, including logistic regression, signal recovery, modelling protein oligomerization, cell tracking, single cell analysis, microfluidics design etc. All concepts are illustrated with python implementations, available through the course Github repository.\n",

New experimental techniques that yield huge amounts of data have made it possible to analyze the complex biological gene and metabolic networks of which these components are part. DNA chips, or microarrays, simultaneously measure the activity of virtually all genes in an organ or tissue. This data can be interpreted and analyzed in roughly two ways. Top-down approaches assume data sets of the entire system, and use data modeling techniques to identify patterns and possible system components. Bottom-up models start from below, with known molecular components and their mutual interactions; they aim to reproduce behavior at the level of the entire system based on the behavior of the individual components.

In this course, we will look at some of the key recovery approaches existing, such as: bio-energy via biogas, organics as compost or even added value products, nutrients to go back to agriculture and so on. The course essentially comprises of two parts. In Part I, the bio-based approaches for recovery are discussed, particularly in a context of urban/industrial environments. Part I is offered in two sessions depending on the background of the incoming students. Course offering A targets students e.g. from the International Master Programme on Environmental Technology and Engineering and offers the sections on anaerobic digestion, composting, fermentation, bio- electrochemical systems, sulfur removal and recovery, biometallurgy. The theoretical course aspects are followed by design calculations, a term paper and a study visit. Course offering B targets students e.g. from the faculty of Science – Biotechnology and offers first an introductory course to wastewater treatment processes after which the same topics as for session A are dealt with. The theoretical course aspects are followed by a term paper and a study visit. Part II (only for course offering A) focuses on agro-industrial processes and biowaste refineries. Part II will build further on biomass conversion techniques discussed in Part yet focuses more on downstream processes that allow recovery of nutrients, energy, chemicals and materials from crops, agro-residues and biobased wastestreams, and on further upgrading and utilization of recovered resources. The course works around actual innovative industrial cases and includes plant visits.\n",

      "This course gives a detailed overview of the complete life cycle of different products and the role that materials play in this life cycle. Material properties determine the material selection during design, but also influence the recyclability of the product afterwards. Various recycling options and advanced recycling technologies are discussed. The scarcity debate is being worked out. The differences between the recycling of bulk materials (steel, aluminum, polymers) and special / technological materials (precious metals) and their specific life cycle structure are given. Waste products from one life cycle can provide highly valuable materials for a different life cycle. Specific material selection tasks are solved, taking into account eg the CO2 footprint. This will lead to general knowledge about recycling, the scarcity debate and other related environmental problems.\n",

Euler-Lagrange, the theory of electrical networks, and bonders are used for classical continuous systems. Vending machines models and hybrid systems also allow for discrete events in the models. The emphasis is on the decomposition of systems in components and on the interaction between components. These models are used for the implementation of simulation tools for quantitative analysis of systems, for the design of feedback controllers and for state estimation. Here are treated: numerical analysis; numerical integration methods, and solution methods for differential-algebraic equations and for rigid systems are studied as well as Monte Carlo simulation for systems with discrete events. Applications on design via dynamic optimization and via model predictive control of controllers of both process control and supervising controllers are considered.

      "Molecular modeling and simulations play a central role in today&#39;s development of industrial processes. It is a multi-disciplinary approach that combines physical and chemical insights to understand what is happening at the nanoscale or at the level of individual chemical reactions. Due to the enormous increase in computational capacities and advanced physical and numerical models, this approach is indispensable from current chemical technology. It can be argued that molecular modeling is now able to supply instruments that can be used for computer-assisted evaluation, innovation and optimization of chemical processes and catalysts starting from the molecular scale. Due to the complexity of industrial processes and the many reactions that can go on simultaneously, it is often impossible to gain insight into individual reactions. Catalysts and processes have often been developed in the past on the basis of try-and-error. The insight on the smallest scale allows smart processes to be developed. The scope is very broad and has already given rise to pioneering results in the development of green and clean processes. The course describes various methods to determine the quantum mechanical electron structure according to first basic principles. This knowledge allows to derive all the molecular properties that are needed to simulate reactions in complex environments. The chemical kinetics and thermodynamics of individual reactions are discussed, as well as a description of the reaction mechanisms in various molecular environments.\n",

The traditional processes are combustion, gasification and carbonisation. The corresponding products are, respectively, heat, combustible gases and coal. This course is intended for explaining the principles of both traditional and new thermochemical conversion processes, and the discussion of different process routes in relation to the desired end products. The origin of biomass and the biomass properties are considered with special attention to environmental and sustainability aspects. Although biological processes are not part of this profession, the relationship between biological and thermochemical processes will be discussed. In concepts of modern bio-refineries, both types of processes are often combined.\n",

The course first discusses the study of the flow of groundwater in saturated soil as well as the available models and calculation techniques for the solution of the basic equations that are drawn up for this. The study of mass transport encompasses the expansion of the above-mentioned basic equations, because in addition to water, contaminants can also move in the groundwater, which is expressed by other comparisons. Subsequently, the flow of groundwater and contaminant transport is treated in unsaturated soil. For this study additional flow characteristics are determined and appropriate constitutive behavioral laws are drawn up. Multi-phase flow occurs when, in addition to and simultaneously with water, another fluid, which is not dissolved in water, moves into the ground. This concerns a 2-phase (saturated flow) or 3-phase (unsaturated ground) flow. Darcy&#39;s law and the basic equations that allow the transport of groundwater to be described can be applied in situations where the level of the groundwater or the hydraulic head has to be changed. This concerns the study of dewatering and draining. In separate chapters, the\n",

Not only the strength of the critical cross-sections and connections must be examined, but also the stability of the components of the load-bearing system such as bending pressure bars, folding of plates, chicken of beams. In this course the geometrical non-linear calculation is also treated whereby the equilibrium relations are written down taking into account the initial setup errors and the deformations.

The focus is on simplified, but nevertheless quite accurate, analytical methods that are excellent for that purpose. The first concern of this course is therefore not to carry out a thorough analysis on such constructions with sophisticated software. Such software (eg Abaqus and Easy) is only used as an aid, and to validate the provided simplified analytical methods.

An economically justified design requires a weighing of the extent to which the structure absorbs the earthquake by means of elastic deformations or plastic deformations. It is about maintaining functionality with regard to collapse danger. Seismic design differs from design in classic loads such as wind load due to the ductility and energy dissipation capacity of the construction.

The dynamics of a nuclear reactor in a nuclear power plant with its short and long term feedbacks are treated. At the end of the first part, the fuel cycle is discussed: the upper phase (from raw material to the production of nuclear fuel bundles) and the lower phase (reprocessing of the spent fuel and waste disposal). In the second part the general transport equation for neutrons is derived, and step by step simplified, whereby it becomes clear under which conditions the simplifications apply. The energy dependence of the neutrons is treated with multi-group equations. In simple geometries, the spatial distribution (flux distribution) in a reactor core is determined with one- and two-group models.

In electronics, for example, there is pressure to design increasingly faster and smaller circuits, but on the other hand, heat transfer is a limiting factor. Heat can be transferred in different ways, which means that knowledge from different scientific domains must be combined. A thorough introduction to hydro- and aerodynamics is necessary to properly understand heat transfer through convection. Heat transfer through conduction is closely related to disciplines such as field theory and electromagnetism. Heat transfer by radiation is based on concepts from (quantum) physics. In the derivation of theory, and in solving practical problems, there is a strong emphasis on analogies with and techniques from different disciplines. In addition to a general description of the different forms of heat transfer, specific attention is given to phenomena that occur in the micro and nanoelectronics, such as heat transfer in sine regimes. On the one hand, specific attention is given to solving thermal problems by means of, for example, cooling fins and fans, but on the other hand attention is also paid to the preventive avoidance of thermal problems through an adapted design.\n",

      "All measurable properties of materials originate in interactions between the nuclei and electrons from which they are constructed. These interactions are described by quantum physics. The mathematical equations that have to be solved for this have been known for a long time. Thanks to efficient algorithms and fast computers, these comparisons can also be solved effectively in more and more cases. Measurable properties of materials can thus be explained directly from quantum physics. Properties that have not yet been measured can be predicted in the same way. In this course we learn how a whole series of properties of solids from quantum physics are calculated through practical computer exercises. Case studies provide an overview of the computational tools available to materials scientists and solid-state physicists to understand and even design materials on an atomic level.\n",

      "Elementary particles are the quanta of their underlying particle field. Consequently, relativistic quantum field theory forms the basis of elementary particle physics. The particle character of a quantum field appears elegantly in the path integral formalism. A perturbative development of the path integral gives rise to a diagrammatic representation of the different particle processes using Feynman diagrams. Elementary particles also have internal symmetries, and for Yang Millship theories with local gauge symmetry, special precautions are required to correctly define the path integral. This gives rise to the introduction of the so-called Faddeev-Popovspook particles that have no physical meaning but serve to keep the theory mathematically consistent (preservation of probability). Another technical issue is the problem of renormalisation: quantum fluctuations on an infinitely small distance scale cause divergences. A modern view of these divergences is provided by the derormalization group. Applications of Yang-Millskwantum field theory are the Weinberg-Salam model for electroweak interactions and quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the theory of quarks and gluons that describes the strong interactions. As an example of an application of the renormalization group, the asymptotic freedom of quarks is discussed in detail. Certain aspects of the quark conflict problem and the non-relativistic quark model are also discussed. We end with a vision of the future: GUT (Grand Unified Theory) and string theory.\n",

      "Information on the Lectures. In biomedical data processing, the aim is to extract clinically, biochemically or pharmaceutically relevant information (e.g rhythms or spikes) in terms of parameters out of low-quality measurements in order to enable an improved medical diagnosis. Typically, biomedical data are affected by large measurement errors, largely due to the noninvasive nature of the measurement process or the severe constraints to keep the input signal as low as possible for safety and bio-ethical reasons. Accurate and automated quantification of this information requires an ingenious combination of the following 4 issues: an adequate pretreatment of the data, the design of an appropriate model and model validation, a fast and numerically robust model parameter quantification method, and an extensive evaluation study, using in-vivo and patient data, up to the embedding of the advanced tools into userfriendly user interfaces to be used by clinicians. To solve each of the above issues, special attention is given to the design of improved models and the development of advanced algorithms, as mentioned above, for processing multichannel biomedical data, possibly acquired using various modalities (e.g. EEG and fMRI).

The goal of this course is to provide a broad survey of several important and well-know fields of data mining and to develop an overall sense of how to extract information from data in a systematic way. It tries to give inisght into the challenges faced by data miners and the inner workers of specific data mining algorithms as well as provide some understanding about why data mining is important and interesting. The course consists of lectures, readings and exercises sessions. The exercise sessions reinforce the central concepts covered during class and give students some experience working with publicly available data mining tools. The course requires knowledge of machine learning.\n",

      "The motivation for the course lies in the urgent need for computer programs that assist people in digesting masses of unstructured information composed of text and other media. We need information retrieval technology when, for instance, we find information on the World Wide Web, in repositories of news and blogs, in biomedical document bases, or in governmental and company archives. Moreover, emails, tweets, other messages and advertisements are searched and filtered. Various techniques of content recognition and linking play an increasing role and allow generating content models of the documents or messages, that effectively match the personalized information needs of users.

Besides problems of supervised learning also methods for unsupervised learning such as kernel principal component analysis are discussed.

The social, cultural, economic and political trajectories of many cities in the Global South have often developed along completely different historical lines than those of cities in Europe and the West. Very often, cities in the South are depicted as problematic or even pathological entities compared to Northern cities, and are assumed to be solely marked by lack, decay, scarcity and marginalisation, by increasing poverty and de-industrialisation, by violence and breakdown, or by an increasing lack of space and an ever-growing demographic density. Although to some extent this might be true, using the words 'poverty', 'violence,' 'slum,' and so on, has also made invisible the everyday practices and experiences of urban dwellers, the concrete content of urban life as lived on a daily basis. These specific urban worlds often remain “shadow cities” (Neuwirth 2006), whose inhabitants are reduced to a sort of invisible “excess humanity” (Davis 2006), and whose capacity to negotiate conditions of scarcity, exclusion and/or poverty is ignored. To investigate these issues, renowned architects, urban planners, anthropologists, geographers, artists, sociologists and engineers will share their alternative readings of these particular urban spaces. Their presentations will acknowledge both the tensions and conflicts at work in such sites, as well as the opportunities that are generated thanks to or in spite of them.

After an introduction to the domain specific terminology and the legal framework, pretreatment (i.e., primary) techniques are introduced, i.e., screening and the removal of non soluble, non biodegradable components (sand, fat and oil). Subsequently, techniques for biological wastewater treatment (i.e., the secondary techniques) are detailed. The focus lies on activated sludge systems since they are the most representative biologically based treatment systems. Traditionally such a system comprises reactors for biodegradation and sedimentation. In the biodegradation tanks, a mixture of predominantly bacteria (the so called activated sludge) breaks down the polluting components in the wastewater in a sequence of anaerobic, anoxic and/or aerobic tanks. Carbon, as well as nitrogen and phosphorus removal is explained, all of them from a biological as well as a modeling/design view point. To accomplish the separation of the purified water from the activated sludge, gravitation is exploited in the sedimentation tanks. Both the physical concepts behind and the state-of-the-art sedimentation models are introduced. As for (waste) activated sludge treatment, anaerobic sludge digestion passes in review. Furthermore, more recent trends and problems such as integrated ways to remove nitrogen and sludge sedimentation failures are discussed. Whenever possible, guest lectures are organized to ensure an up-to-date vision on the currently implemented practices. As for the tertiary techniques, special attention is devoted to physicochemical techniques like adsorption, pressure drive membrane techniques and membrane bioreactors, neutralization, precipitation methods, ion exchange and disinfection. For each technique it is indicated which water quality can be reached. On the basis of the introduced tertiary techniques, the avenues for water reuse are explored.

      "!!! During the academic year 2018-2019 , the title of this course DOES NOT COVER its content. See below for the correct content ... !!! Course: Chemical Engineering for Human Health Lecturers: Pedro Fardim and Erin Koos The definition of human health is complex and multifaceted. In addition to genetics, the health of individuals is controlled by external and environmental factors, which influence cell metabolism and introduce mutations that lead to numerous diseases such as cancer and allergies or promote healthy states such as caused by pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals. Numerous products in common, everyday use are either formulated to specifically influence human health or have an incidental effect. Chemical engineers have an active role in health and well-being creation. In this course, we focus on a chemical engineering perspective of health and how a chemical engineer can create new solutions to current challenges to human health. We aim to motivate the students to think outside of the box and with focus on building bridges of multi and interdisciplinarity. Moreover, we address challenges and opportunities for chemical engineering for health that are of high relevance for the booming cluster of life sciences in Flanders and in Europe. The course has 10 lectures with focus on new trends and future emerging technologies related to functional therapeutics, functional prevention and future processes for health care.\n",

Chapter 2: Material selection When selecting a polymer for a specific process, some aspects have to be taken into account: rheological parameters, transitions temperatures, thermodynamic behavior… This chapter aims at understanding the processing-properties relationship. Since flow conditions during processing are closely related to the material parameters, fundamental understanding of these material parameters is crucial. Chapter 3: Extrusion In this chapter, one of the most important processing techniques, namely extrusins, will be discussed in detail. This chapters aims on the one hand, at mathematical modelling of the different extrusion zones and on the other hand at designing nozzles and identifying extrusion instabilities. Chapter 4: Injection molding This chapter treats the most important discontinuous technique, namely injection molding. The cycle is discussed in detail after which attention is given to modelling of the filling of the mould. Mould design is therefore an important aspect and the link with numerical simulations is highlighted. Last, frequently made injection molding errors are discussed and solved. Chapter 5: Shape stabilisationThe solidification process of a shaped material is very important since the final material properties are formed in this stage.

They understand for which type of propositions these languages are suitable and are capable of expressing relevant properties in these languages and to use these to solve certain types of tasks and problems, including verification tasks by means of suitable forms of inference. They should be able to motivate the choice for the formal system or the form of inference. Global advantages and disadvantages of the techniques are known and have to be used in this choice. The connections and differences between the different languages are understood. Students are capable of recognizing the relevant concepts in a problem domain and to design a logical vocabulary for them. They can distinguish not only explicit but also implicit information in a problem setting and can express both types of information in the logics of this course, or they can evaluate whether these logics are suitable for expressing these. They can analyze tasks and problems and classify them as formal logic inference tasks. They are capable of specifying these inference tasks in a concrete way and let them solve by a suitable inference tool. The students are familiar with a number of static information concepts such as enumeration, sufficient and necessary conditions, inductive definitions, unique name propositions, domain closure propositions. They are familiar with information concepts in the context of dynamic systems such as inertia, pre and postconditions, state formulas and invariants, causal rules, and with process properties including fairness, deadlock, aliveness, reachability. They have an understanding of modelling at different levels of abstraction and of the refinement principle to connect these different levels of abstraction. The students are also familiar with fundamental logical concepts such as model semantics, logical entailment, satisfiability, logical equivalence, contradiction. They know fundamental results and what they mean, such as the incompleteness theorem of Goedel, expressiveness limitations and the undecidability of classical logic and extensions. For certain of these properties they can formulate the proof. The students are able to understand proof principles for proving or disproving invariants, refinement statements, and process properties. The students understand a number of fundamental inference algorithms and can describe and apply these, and explain their complexity.

Formal languages consists of collections of ﬁnite sequences (known as strings or words) of symbols from a ﬁnite set. Recognizers consist of ﬁnite state automata, push-down automata, and Turing machines. As all algorithmic problems can be seen as language recognition problems, issues of complexity and computability will be studied in this context. In addition, students will be introduced to the language, methods, and terminology of graph theory, and acquire an understanding the different classes of graphs and of modelling using graphs. Students will appreciate the applicability of graph theory in other areas of computer science, such as networking and optimisation. Objectives At the end of the course the student should be able to Determine the language recognised by a given ﬁnite state machine; convert between ﬁnite state machines and regular expressions; Minimise a ﬁnite state machine. Determinise a non-deterministic ﬁnite state machine. Prove that certain problems are NP-complete or uncomputable. Describe major complexity classes and understand their practical consequences.

The basics of security engineering technology Several basic security mechanisms are discussed, including: security protocols: that specify how different stakeholders in the system are to communicate or interact with each other. We cover simple authentication, and challenge response protocols, as well as common attacks against these. passwords are discussed in some depth as an example of one of the simpler, better-known and widely used mechanisms. We discuss the design space, attacks against password mechanisms and technical countermeasures against these attacks. Then, the course discusses access control and cryptographic mechanisms, again by first looking at simple settings: access control in a centralized setting cryptography for entity authentication and secure communication. 3.

From the individual level, we move on to the team level, and study conditions, and processes that contribute to (in) effective decision making in organisational teams. Decision making, particularly in the top of organisations, is often related with organisational change. We explore the relation between these two, both in terms of content (what direction changes take), as well as processes (who are involved in the decision making, in what ways, and how is the implementation of changes related to the ways decisions are made?). Special attention will be given to conflict in teams, how to deal with these in context of decision making. Is it possible to make conflicts productive and how can you do that?

      "„» Digital communication is widely taught in electrical engineering programs. This is no surprise—the mathematical theory of digital communication is beautiful and elegant. There has been a growing separation, however, in the abstract content of a typical course and what is implemented in practice. This difference is particularly evident in wireless communication systems, which have their own set of specific challenges, non-idealities, and hardware constraints. As a byproduct of the growing rift between theory and practice, and the increasing reliance on simulation, many students are not prepared to apply their abstract knowledge in a real digital wireless communication system. In this lab you will learn how to design and implement a wireless communication solution. Using a software defined radio platform, you will first learn how to program a simple wireless packet transmitter and receiver and get practical experience with various aspects related to wireless communication. This includes for instance channel coding, modulation and demodulation, timing recovery and forward error correction. When the wireless link is up and running, one of two possible extension will be considered. A first possibility is an extension towards OFDM, requiring more advanced channel estimation, equalization, timing recovery in time and frequency domain and non-idealities compensation. A second possibility is adding wireless MAC functionalities, enabling to set up a local network between multiple nodes. The lab will be mainly working on the implementation of the algorithms, but sufficient theory will be provided to ensure the basic concepts are understood.\n",

      "This course provides an introduction to privacy technologies. We will explain the various types of privacy risks and introduce a range of existing privacy technologies that address these risks. These include: cryptographic protocols with applications to privacy, including: private information retrieval, oblivious transfer, anonymous e-cash, anonymous authentication, and private search. communication privacy , including: anonymous communication systems, censorship resistant communications, and traffic analysis methods and attacks. database privacy , including: k-anonymization, de-anonymization algorithms, and differential privacy. privacy in social networks , including: protection of shared content, protection of user interactions, and tools for assistance with privacy relevant decision-making. location privacy , including: space-temporal cloaking, mix zones, and privacy-preserving access to location-based services.\n",

      "Here are three reasons why you might want to take this course: First , as engineer you will be designing, implementing, or managing electronic systems and services that in most cases have privacy implications. For example, ambient sensors and biomedical implants collect, process, store, and communicate (sometimes highly sensitive) data related to individuals; the data generated by ubiquitous electronic communications provides detailed insight into people’s activities and lifestyle; and the personalization of multimedia applications and services relies on learning about individuals’ most intimate preferences and adapting to them. The first objective ( O1 ) of the course is that you are able to identify the privacy concerns that arise in different scenarios. For example, if you are designing a new video-on-demand service for mobile phones, what could go wrong for your future users’ privacy? The second objective ( O2 ) is that you are able to relate privacy concerns to technical design choices . For example, what privacy risks arise from relying on unique identifiers? or from centralizing the storage and processing of data? Privacy technologies aim to mitigate privacy concerns. The third objective ( O3 ) is that you understand the principles underlying the design of privacy technologies . For example, anonymity technologies require diversity (of users, uses, attributes, internet subnets, etc.); advanced cryptographic protocols enable sophisticated services (e.g., smart metering) while minimizing the disclosure of data beyond what seems intuitively possible; and differential privacy ensures that queries to database of personal records cannot be used to determine if a particular individual record is included in the database. Most of the privacy technologies covered in the course are designed following security engineering principles. A necessary part of security engineering is the security evaluation of the system. This involves defining the adversary model and devising attack strategies. The fourth objective ( O4 ) is thus that you are able to analyze privacy technologies and evaluate their vulnerabilities with respect to different adversary models . For example, how can an anonymized social graph be re-identified? To what extent do anonymous communication services (such as Tor) provide you with anonymity for browsing the web? Can your encrypted Skype conversation be reconstructed through traffic analysis? Second , you will deal with privacy issues not only as an engineer but also as an individual and as a member of society. As an individual, you use a variety of services: mobile communications, online shopping, search engines such as Google, social media such as Facebook or Twitter, etc. The fifth objective of this course ( O5 ) is that you become aware of what privacy issues are associated to the use of different services, what are your basic (legal) rights concerning privacy and data protection, and what technologies you can use to mitigate your exposure to privacy risks. As a result of this, you will be able to form your own informed opinions on how privacy issues should be addressed in our increasingly technological society. Many of these privacy issues are at the heart of ongoing debates whose outcome will have an influence on how society is shaped: Is the tracking of Internet users necessary for the economic sustainability of the Internet? Might profiling and personalization lead to social sorting and discrimination? Should certain content be censored? Should user communications be stored for long periods of time for the purpose of law-enforcement investigations? Are we building an unprecedented mass surveillance infrastructure, or are overblown privacy concerns an obstacle to data-driven innovation? Finally , the course is heavily based on recent research. By participating in this course you will get a first hand experience of what research is like . The sixth objective ( O6 ) is that you learn to read, critically review, and present scientific articles .\n",

      "The challenge we face to change our energy system into a sustainable one is enormous. The change it requires it not just a technical improvement of the current system, but indeed a complete overhaul of the current energy system. Such a change cannot happen in the realm of technology alone, nor can it be solved in a laboratory. Changes will be needed at different levels, will be technical, social, legal, organisational, regulatory, etc.,etc. in character, and will be coupled with each other. Such combinations of system changes are called 'transitions'. Although there is a lot of talking about transitions and even 'transition management', a fundamental understanding of processes of technical and societal (i.e. socio-technical) change is often lacking among those involved in these processes. This course aims to provide more insight in these issues and is aimed at those students that want to and will be involved in it. In addition students will also learn some skills how to analyse and act within transition processes. To understand processes of scientific and technological change the course will start with some basic history and philosophy of science.

The basic differences between the two models will be highlighted, but also the more philosophical difficulties that remained, despite the obvious succes of the new Modern model. Even after more than 350 years of successes of modern science, these discussions have led to different perceptions on how to interpret reality, varying from a Baconian radical positivism (Wiener Kreis), via moderate neo-positivism (Karl Popper) and historic paradigm-based thinking (Thomas Kuhn) to almost relativistic constructivism (Bruno Latour). An important shift in these discussions has been that, instead of just defining general principles for 'good science' and applying them in theoretical essays, science and technology philosophers started to look at historical cases (the 'historical turn') and finally by setting up their own contemporary research ('empirical turn'). This was the basis for what we call today \"Science and Technology Studies (STS)\", i.e. the study of how science and technology change by studying specific cases using very detailed anthropological and historical research tools. More and more STS studies were combined with insights from new directions in Economics research, such as evolutionary economics and industrial economics. The main findings and discussions of these studies will be summarised in the course. About 10 years ago academics started to wonder how all these insights could help society to pursue transitions that are desired, such as a transition towards a sustainable energy system. They came up with a model, which is a pragmatic mixture of very differents schools of thought. This model is called 'Transition Management'. During the last 10 years this model has been developed further and several tools and subtools for transition management have been developed. We will look at the basics of the model and try to see (in student groups) if we can frame historical cases in this model. Then we will start looking at the need for a transition towards a sustainable energy system and define subcases of this transition to be worked out by the students in the groups. An oral examination over all the material of the course, together with the written preparatory notes of each student will define each individual's student rating.\n",

      "At the end of the course students will have acquired new insights and new skills . The insights will be based on a focused understanding of basic philosophy of science concepts and how these lead to modern day transition theory . This transition theory will be applied to cases focused on the future transition towards a more sustainable energy system.\n",

The student should already be comfortable with calculus and probability theory. Prior knowledge of basic notions of finance is useful. We start with providing some background on the financial markets and the instruments traded. We will look at different kinds of derivative securities, the main group of underlying assets, the markets where derivative securities are traded and the financial agents involved in these activities. The fundamental problem in the mathematics of financial derivatives is that of pricing and hedging. The pricing is based on the no-arbitrage assumptions. We start by discussing option pricing in the simplest idealised case: the Single-Period Market. Next, we turn to Binomial tree models. Under these models we price European and American options and discuss pricing methods for the more involved exotic options. Monte-Carlo issues come into play here. Next, we set up general discrete-time models and look in detail at the mathematical counterpart of the economic principle of no-arbitrage: the existence of equivalent martingale measures. We look when the models are complete, i.e. claims can be hedged perfectly. We discuss the Fundamental theorem of asset pricing in a discrete setting. To conclude the course, we make a bridge to continuous-time models. We introduce and study the Black-Scholes model in detail.\n",

      "The deformation of a metal has two direct consequences. On a 'macro scale' the desired shape change is obtained and on a 'micro scale' the microstructure of the material is changed. This microstructure is related to the mechanical and physical properties of the metal and is heavily dependent of some external parameters like temperature, strain, strain rate, deformation mode, lubricants, etc. The blacksmith in ancient times was mainly concerned with the macroscopic shape change, but the modern metal industry requires thermo-mechanical processes that lead to a product with optimal properties, not only concerning dimensional precision and appearance, but also concerning mechanical and physical properties. The aim of the present course is to give an overview of the main manufacturing processes but also to provide some understanding of the complicated relations between a forming process and the microstructure of a metal on one hand and between this microstructure and the mechanical properties on the other hand. In part I of this course ('Science') some more theoretical aspects are treated. It is assumed that the student has already acquired some basic knowledge of elasticity and plasticity theory and of physical metallurgy. This knowledge will be further developed, focussed on phenomena that occur during or are related to deformation (strengthening, substructure development, recrystallisation, crystallographic textures, residual stresses, friction, etc.) In part II of this course ('Technology') the most important metal forming operations are described. This part is mainly focussed on the 'macro scale' (shaping a metallic part) although also here some connections with the microstructure will be made. For example in the chapter about 'sheet metal forming' the main issue is the relation between material properties (e.g. plastic anisotropy) and formability. The third part of this course (\"case studies\") is devoted to the 'micro scale'. In a number of case studies the thermo-mechanical processing of some products is analysed and discussed. The examples show how properties can be optimised by a careful control of the microstructure during processing.\n",

      "Organizational behavior (OB) is the study of how people think, feel, and act in organizations and similarly, how they are affected by the activities within organizations. OB is interested in the behavior of people embedded in specific contexts of organizational systems. Put simply, OB is about how people act in organizations, why they act as they do, and what we can do to predict and manage their behavior. Three levels of analysis guide the field: the individual, the team, and the organization. Examples of important questions that are examined within the OB field are: Is it ok for a CEO to earn a salary 500 times higher than his or her subordinates? Are we more creative when we feel happy, or when we feel sad? Do gender quotas work in promoting more women at the top? What do the objects in your office say about you? How (and how quickly) is a recruiter's impression of an applicant formed during a job interview (for instance, how bad is it to have visible tattoos)? Do people make better decisions in a group or alone? To what extent is our behavior at work still a product of our caveman tendencies? Can stress be a good thing? Is it better to weigh your options for a long time in search for the ‘perfect’ choice, or to decide early and not think about it any further? If you could compose a 'dream team' of talented people, what would be the ideal percentage of 'geniuses' in that team (hint: not 100%, and not even 50%)?

      "By explaining the main currents of thought that have affected the theory and practice of urban planning and design since the reconstruction after the Second World War, the ambition is to create an awareness of the urban paradigms that have played a role in shaping the city in the western hemisphere since the end of the second world war. The emphasis lies on urbanism, not on urbanization. Design concepts that have inspired the discipline of urbanism are critically investigated, and their incidence on practice is discussed by examining representative projects and interventions. This analysis of how the idea filters through in practice, but also of how the experience of city making affects theory, is intended to help the student assess his/her own concepts related to the formation of cities in a more comprehensive frame. Ex cathedra explanations, mainly directed towards the comprehensive interpretation of currents and ideas. Intensive use of drawings, sketches and photographs is strongly advocated here, in view of clarifying notions that otherwise might remain too abstract. Group seminar discussions around presentations by students of selected texts or projects highlighting particular themes that are addressed in the ex cathedra explanation. The intention is here to clarify by focusing on the particular example and help to understand the latter as a part of a more general theory. Because of the format, personal intervention on the part of the student is stimulated, with the aim of spelling out what may be the precise problem of understanding that remains.\n",

Typical examples include pattern recognition, biomedical engineering and bioinformatics, signal processing and system identification, process industry, fraud detection, Web mining, e-commerce, financial applications, etc. In each of these areas, artificial neural networks are an important technique for analysis and design of systems. Neural networks are universal approximators, possess a parallel architecture and learn on-line or in batch mode from given sample patterns and lead to powerful methods for modeling. Training of neural networks can be both supervised and unsupervised. The course provides an overview of the main classical and advanced modern techniques around data mining and neural networks. Commonly used types of neural networks (such as multilayer perceptrons, radial basis function networks ) are discussed, including structure, learning algorithms, optimization methods, on-line versus batch training generalization aspects, validation, feedforward and recurrent networks, statistical interpretations, pruning, variance reduction, decision functions, density estimation and regularization theory. Special attention is given to efficient and reliable algorithms for classification and function estimation and processing of large data sets for data mining applications. Furthermore, emphasis is given on preprocessing, feature selection, dimensionality reduction and incorporation of expert knowledge. In addition to the traditional neural network techniques in supervised learning more advanced methods (kernel-based methods) are also used as Bayesian inference, statistical learning theory and support vector machines handled. With respect to unsupervised techniques are cluster algorithms (and related methods such as EM algorithm), vector-quantization and self-organzing maps discussed.\n",

      "Embedded Control Systems has several objectives, some non-technical: Objective 1 This course is an introduction to embedded control systems , with an emphasis on the smart moving machines of the next generation , i.e., robots, cars, trucks, machine tools, airplanes, satellites, combine harvesters, etc. The objective is to introduce the students to the roles and responsibilities of innovation project engineers in companies that design and develop such embedded control systems. Actively striving to introduce “innovation” in a company is a very important attitude that the course wants to stimulate, with the design deliverable as the main outcome. Objective 2 Within the very broad context of “embedded systems”, the course puts strong emphasis on: the systems-level thinking: every part of the system is selected and tuned for the goals of the whole system. innovative design : comparison of possible alternatives should be done on the basis of informed and motivated argumentations, and each design should clearly identify why it is “better” than what exists already. design automation : what standards and tools exist to support the design in large-scale projects, in which no single person can keep the overview and control of the whole design process . Objective 3 The concrete contents of the course are detailed during the first lectures, in dialogue with the students. Indeed, students are expected to have a strong influence on these concrete course contents, since this is a perfect example of how, in their future professional live, they will be responsible for their company's initiatives, innovation and realisations! A major aspect of this responsibility is that the students must make sure that they learn effectively and sufficiently, by pro-actively engaging in a constructively critical interaction with the teaching team and with their peers. In other words, learning is an continuous and conscious activity , so certainly not something one postpones until the examination period… Learning targets The course targets the following “ ACQA indicators ” used to describe learning objectives that courses should try to focus on and optimize (Source: Criteria voor Academische Bachelor en Master Curricula , P.M.M. Rullmann, R.A. van Santen, W.H.M. Zijm, 2005): Skilled in research : students are taught how to do research, that is, how to explore and structure new domains of knowledge in a systematic and goal-oriented way. Scientific approach : the learning takes place via the formulation and motivation of hypotheses and models to explain the working of the “world”, and the consequent corroboration or refutation of those hypotheses via confrontation with the factual reality and/or the input from more experienced peers. Takes temporal and societal context into account : knowledge only has added value in specific application contexts, and that value is often determined not only by technical properties but also by legal, ethical and societal values, norms and beliefs.\n",

      "Motivation In current mechanical engineering practice, where we are constantly striving for more energy efficient and thus lighter, optimised products, safety margins become more and more narrow. In this context, reliability is becoming a critical aspect, that requires attention from the earliest design phase until the end-of-life of a product. Rendering failure impossible might seem as the ultimate goal when designing new products. Don’t we all want to fly an airplane that simply cannot crash? Or build nuclear plants that can withstand any earthquake? Unfortunately, it is not the binary principle of failure (im)possibility that determines the acceptability of a design. Since neither the eventually produced product nor its environment can be predicted in a deterministic sense, it is all about probability. Keeping that probability of failure at an acceptable level, has become one of the key challenges for engineers today. Course objectives The objective of this course is to provide students with a general overview of different aspects of reliability in current mechanical engineering practice. The students gain insight in the typical methodologies for reliability prediction, analysis, verification and optimization. Apart from the methods, they also gain insight in the typical causes of mechanical failure. Furthermore, since the short life cycle of many mechanical products complicates the use of field data and prototype testing in reliability assessment, reliability becomes more and more a critical aspect that needs to be integrated in the design from the earliest phases of the design process. After successful completion of this course, the student will have insight in and knows how to apply modern methods that are used to predict and verify reliability in this context. Lectures learning outcomes After successful completion of this course, the student has proven to know and understand the meaning of standard terminology in reliability analysis techniques. He is able to select specific distribution types for different classes of reliability problems, and to apply probability theory on these in order to perform the time dependent reliability analysis of mechanical components. He is able to analyze testing data with respect to the lifetime of a mechanical component, and to transform this information into standard distributions that serve as input for the reliability assessment on the system level. He is able to quantify the reliability of a complex built-up mechanical system, starting from the analysis on the component level, using quantitative techniques. He can apply Markov process modeling for time dependent reliability assessment of systems including repair and maintenance. He is able to describe the main properties of qualitative and semi-quantitative techniques for system analysis, to apply the principles of these methodologies on basic problems, and to critically assess their value in a mechanical engineering context. In the framework of fatigue analysis, the student can derive and interpret typical material properties for stress-based approaches, he has insight into the sensitivity of these properties with respect to operational conditions, and is able to apply the stress-based approach for the assessment of the lifetime of a mechanical component that is under regular and irregular time dependent loading, for uni-axial as well as multi-axial stress conditions. The student further knows how stress-based analysis can be extended to the strain-based approach, he can derive and knows how to interpret the corresponding material properties, and knows when and how to apply this technique for the assessment of the lifetime of a mechanical component. The student understands the basic principles of damage tolerant design, and knows how to apply the theoretical principles of linear fracture mechanics in this context.

Therefore, attention will also be paid to aspects such as modelling, interpretation of results... offer potential developers of own finite elements programs (for new applications) the necessary basic knowledge.\n",

      "The aim of the course is to give a rigorous yet accessible introduction to the modern theory of financial mathematics. The student should already be comfortable with calculus and probability theory. Prior knowledge of basic notions of finance is useful. We start with providing some background on the financial markets and the instruments traded. We will look at different kinds of derivative securities, the main group of underlying assets, the markets where derivative securities are traded and the financial agents involved in these activities. The fundamental problem in the mathematics of financial derivatives is that of pricing and hedging. The pricing is based on the no-arbitrage assumptions. We start by discussing option pricing in the simplest idealised case: the Single-Period Market. Next, we turn to Binomial tree models. Under these models we price European and American options and discuss pricing methods for the more involved exotic options. Monte-Carlo issues come into play here. Next, we set up general discrete-time models and look in detail at the mathematical counterpart of the economic principle of no-arbitrage: the existence of equivalent martingale measures. We look when the models are complete, i.e. claims can be hedged perfectly. We discuss the Fundamental theorem of asset pricing in a discrete setting. To conclude the course, we make a bridge to continuous-time models. We introduce and study the Black-Scholes model in detail.\n",

Part II: System integration Electronic systems fabrication can be viewed as an assembly and packaging of a number of components. For today’s advanced systems, the typical components are complex integrated circuits (so called Silicon chips), that are studied in Part II of this course. However, for the system to be optimally performing, the “assembly” techniques are crucial, and with the advancement of the performance of the IC, also different and more complex assembly techniques have been developed to match ultimate system requirements. Furthermore, new applications have emerged, as RF and biomedical, that demand specific system form factors and/or encapsulations. Hence, system integration has gone a long way from soldering Dual-In-Line packaged ICs on a Printed Circuit Board… The purpose of this part of the course is to understand the technology of combining and packaging integrated circuits: - techniques on Si level, including wafer-level packaging, multi-chip modules and 3D integration - first level packaging and bonding - application dependent second level packaging (e.g. RF, sensor, biomedical) Furthermore, the course wants to give more general insights in mechanical properties and thermal management relevant for building electronic systems.

      "The first objective is to give an overview of the state of the art in technology and principles that allow to measure the dynamic responses of living organisms (humans, animals, plants). The integration of these responses is possible when these responses can be measured in a continuous on-line way. The course gives an overview of the principles to demonstrate that many sensors and techniques are available to measure on-line biological responses from humans, animals and plants. The second step shows how to use these signals to model the dynamic behaviour of the complex individual and time varying dynamic (CITD) living organism to variations in the environment. Environment is here defined as all variables that are not genetically defined such as physics, chemical, nutrition, medication, etc. In this second step the objective is to demonstrate how these CITD systems can be modelled in an efficient way by using on-line data based mechanistic models. The third step wants to educate how an objective function can be calculated to develop model based controllers for living organisms. These principles can be used to develop monitoring and control algorithms in a wide range of biological processes such as environment control in livestock houses, greenhouses and storage systems, monitoring and treatment of critical ill patients in intensive care units, on-line monitoring off animal welfare, bio-monitoring of water quality or environment quality.\n",

      "Science communication aims at making science more accessible to the general public, a.o. by increasing scientific literarcy of citizens. Of crucial importance is the creation of a relation of trust among scientists and the public. This requires a clear understanding of the aims of science communication, as well as its channels and strategies. The course focuses on the gap between science an the public, in particular in relation to the place of science in public media. Different forms of science communication are related to different intended target audiences. The topics to be treated can be arranged our four general themes. 1. Science in Public This model introduces basic concepts in the understanding of the process of science communication: theories about of definitions and models of science communication, the role of the expert, scientific literacy, the image of science in society. 2. Science and the media Media play an important part in science communication, but, as they are working withintheir proper cultural value system and with speficif formats, they may also be seen as a potential threat to the reliability and accuracy of scientific messages and of the representation of science. Attention is given to the differences and tensions between the cultures of science and journalism. Students will also prepare written expositions on scientific themes. 3. Controversial science and risk communication A special challenge to science communicators is to speak out on themes where no scientific certainty is avalaible, or when the topics are framed in a larger (political) debate. To represent scientific views often merges with a taking of sides, which then may threaten the neutrality of science. This form of communication is often preferred by audiovisual media. Also science blogs tend in this direction. 4. Interactive and participative communication Science in the public sphere has to be viewed as an interactive process, in which the dominating role of the expert cannot be taken for granted. In this form of communication the public takes a central role. This theme focuses on science centres, science cafés, citizen science,... and the approach to disseminate scientific information through informal learning, based on psychological models of leanring. The course analyses the use of interactive and participative communication in different settings.\n",

      "Quantum communication and information processing (QIPC) is a rapidly growing field that takes advantage of the most counter-intuitive aspects of quantum mechanics to develop new technologies. In this framework, no-cloning theorem is exploited to communicate more securely, while coherence and entanglement become resources to compute in a more efficient way than in the classical world. Moreover, approaching the quantum limits paves the road to ultra-sensitive measurements in various fields of physics such as photonics, mechanics or electrical engineering. In these various fields, the ability to beat decoherence, namely, to isolate and control quantum systems, was crucial. Technological progresses have allowed fulfilling these challenging objectives, such that quantum protocols are now investigated in various experimental setups. This course will present an introduction to quantum information and more generally to quantum engineering, with examples taken from photonics and superconducting circuits. It will expose the mains tools and concepts of quantum technologies, for students curious about this intriguing topic, whether they envisage embarking on a PhD, or they just want to acquire a scientific background in this domain.\n",

Biological systems are complex and their function is based on various macromolecules (DNA, RNA, proteins, polysaccharides) and defined aggregates (lipid membranes), and on a wide variety of receptor-ligand interactions. A typical approach to understanding is therefore to characterize minimal model systems using biophysical methods and then add increasing levels of complexity. Since it is methods rather than problems that typify the field of Biophysical Chemistry, we mainly introduce these by illustrating how they can be applied to problems concerning DNA. However, the principles are general and examples showing how the techniques are equally applicable to proteins are also dealt with.

      "This new course is based on the former course FFY070 Liquid crystals physics and applications (4.5 points / 3cu). In the new course (7.5 points) the amount of material is increased, especially regarding LC applications. The experimental part is significantly expanded through a lab-project, in which the students in depth study individually choosen subjects within the frame of the course. Most people are familiar with the fact that matter can exist in three different states: solid, liquid and gas. However, this is a simplification, and under extreme conditions other forms of matter can exist, e.g. plasma at very high temperatures or superfluid helium at very low temperatures. But we do not have to go to these extreme conditions to find new forms of order in matter. In liquid crystals, which are anisotropic fluids, the molecular order lies between those of the isotropic liquid and the crystal and the classification of liquid crystals is based on their degrees of orientational and positional order. From a basic physics point of view these materials are of large interest and have contributed to the modern understanding of phase transitions and critical phenomena, and to the knowledge about order phenomena in one, two, and three dimensions. To common people liquid crystals are today almost synonomous to flat panel displays (Liquid Crystal Displays, LCDs) for TVs, computers, mobile phones, and other electronic equipment. But there is also a rapid development of other types of application, for instance in telecommunication, pattern recognition, real time holography, non-mechanical beam steering etc. Liquid crystals consitute a unique form of soft matter and are becoming more and more important also in pure materials science in the development of polymer materials and biomaterials. The existence of life is directly dependent on self-organizing soft matter and here liquid crystalline systems are very important. One example is our cell membranes which consist of so-called lyotropic liquid crystals. The course will give a basic understanding of the physics and different applications of liquid crystals. The content ranges from the history of liquid crystal science, from the first observations in the late nineteenth century, via the development of theories of the liquid crystalline state, the development of liquid crystal displays and examples of today s state of the art research. After about 30 years of strong focus on liquid crystal displays, a large part of the liquid crystal research is today shifting towards nanoscience, colloidal systems, biological systems and, on the applicational side, towards photonics and microwave electronics. The course will stress on how knowledge in optics, thermodynamics, electromagnetism, vector analysis, symmetry analysis, etc. constitutes the basis for the very rapid development of liquid crystal displays and devices that we use every day. Furthermore, the course will through laboratory projects and demonstrations give an introduction to the manufacturing of liquid crystal displays. 1.

More information: https://www.student.chalmers.se/sp/course?course_id=23684 Microelectronics is presently entering the era of nanoelectronics. The scaling down of microprocessors to \"nanoprocessors\" will eventually require entirely new computer architectures and computational concepts. One will have to address questions like: how small can programmable logic gates become; can they be made from nanoscale devices other than conventional transistors; can other types of nanoscale structures be used as computer devices? Also, there are well defined limits on what up to date technology for producing electronic components can achieve. In this context, the question is whether we need to develop new ways of computing, e.g. try to mix artificial nanostructures with organic molecules and biomolecules, and even artificial and living cells and other biological matter. If these systems can be made selfassembling, then it might be possible to construct evolvable hardware and selfassembling computer devices. To this, one can add computational systems based on chemical and biological reactions and artificial and living neural networks and brains. The course aims at describing current trends and future expectations concerning systems and \"hardware\" for information processing. Following topics are discussed: (1) The present development of Nanoelectronics, Molecular electronics and Bioelectronics, and the consequences for functionality and computational schemes; (2) fundamental physical limitations of computational devices and schemes; (3) development of different computer architectures like reconfigurable computers, reversible and quantum computers, cellular automata, neural networks, brains, and biochemical computing. Improvement of existing CMOS technology will eventually be impossible due to either fundamental or economic limits. In order to continue the miniaturization and performance increase of information processing devices, alternative architectures, materials, assembling techniques and models for information processing are currently explored in various research activities.

      "General Semiconductors, and the use of them, have a very important (maybe even crucial) role in science and industrial applications. They also have a large impact on the social life in general due to the rapid development of new devices and the practical use of them. New requests within the fields of opto and high frequency applications are exemplified by semiconductor lasers in CD-ROM s and high speed transistors in mobile phones. Other applications for computers, displays and even lamps for lightning depend on the use of new semiconductors and heterostructures. Therefore, the need of semiconductors and the know-how about them are of crucial importance in the whole area of technology. The aim The Course gives both an overview and a deep understanding of semiconducting materials in general, their limitations and advantages, the knowledge about semiconductor material physics and finally properties of heterostructures. The course provides the students a knowledge ranging from basis to applications. Content and organisation Introduction: some history, definitions, overview about materials, the use of semiconductors for different purposes, elemental semiconductors versus compound semiconductors and brief description of device processing made in clean rooms. Semiconductor physics: crystal structure, single crystal surface structures, phonons, electron structure, electron band structure and dispersion, band gap, material modifications introduced by an alloy, effects of impurities and defects, electron transport and optical properties. Heterostructures: contacts, interfaces, band gap discontinuities, potential diagrams, simple quantum structures and superlattices. Materials: classification of semiconductors from the periodic table, overview of electronic materials, organic semiconductors, presentation of bulk single crystal growth and description of epitaxial layer growth by MBE and MOVPE. Device structures: examples of heterostructures used for devices. A few practices and demonstrations and a miniproject are made.\n",

A tremendous importance of superconductivity for fundamental science can be seen from the fact that there are at least 12 Nobel laureates in physics, who obtained the price for research related to superconductivity. Besides being of tremendous interest in themselves and vehicles for development key concepts and methods in theoretical physics, superconductors have found important applications in modern society.

The continuous progress in patterning, instrumentation and simulation over the past decades has made possible the investigation of low-dimensional magnetic elements such as thin films and nanostructures. New properties arise in these due to the reduction of dimensionality and the ability to built artificial stackings. Beyond the development of fundamental knowledge, these bring new functionalities of interest for technology. Such is the case for Giant Magneto-Resistance, an effect combining together electronics and magnetism, as the resistance of a stacked device may strongly depend on the arrangement of magnetization in the sub-stacks.

Chapter 2 is also introductory, but puts the emphasis on the analysis of multiple linked and correlated signals. Chapter 3 exclusively deals with filtering to delete artefacts, an important pre-processing step for the actual signal analysis. By means of a great number of illustrations the effect of different filtering techniques will be discussed.

At the end of the semester, two follow up sessions will be planned (on Wednesday December 8 and Wednesday December 15, 2010). First, we start with the presentation of a few motivating examples from statistics that require the optimization of an objective function and/or the approximation of an integral that is analytically not solvable. Examples that will be considered include (not exhaustive): univariate normal model, linear normal regression, the estimation of a proportion, logistic regression, the analysis of contingency tables, a model with gamma-distributed observations, a finite mixture of normals, a mixed model for paired observations, a generalized linear mixed model, a contingency table with incomplete data, bivariate continuous data with missing observations. Second, we will offer some basic tools from multivariate calculus (gradient, Hessian, Taylor series expansion) and from statistics (exponential family).We will define the optimization problem in a formal way and study the necessary and sufficient conditions for its solution. Third, it will be shown that in some cases the optimal parameter estimates can be found directly but in other cases an iterative algorithm is needed. Fourth, some basic methods for iteration-based function optimization will be explained. We start by illustrating methods for the optimization of functions of one variable (bisection, regula falsi, Newton’s method) and then we turn to the optimization of functions of more than one variable. Several frequently used algorithms for multivariate function optimization in a statistical context are presented (e.g., Newton-Raphson, quasi-Newton, steepest descent, downhill simplex, iterative proportional fitting) which differ from each other in the amount of information they use about the surface of the objective function. An alternative to Newton-Raphson that is popular among statisticians, Fisher scoring, will also be studied. The mechanics, advantages and disadvantages of the proposed methods will be illustrated. Because analytical differentiation is not always feasible, we show how numerical differentiation works. Fifth, the course provides an introduction to the field of constrained optimization. The straightforward, but not always applicable, technique of reparameterization will be discussed. An introduction to the theory of Lagrange multipliers will be offered. The connection with shrinkage problems will be made. Sixth, we discuss the relationship between the maximization of the (log)likelihood and statistical inference: asymptotic properties of the MLE, estimates of precision, and testing problems. Seventh, the course covers in detail models that contain an integral that has to be evaluated (linear and generalized linear mixed models). In some cases the integral can be solved analytically but in other cases it has to be approximated numerically. An overview of techniques for numerical integration (e.g., Gaussian quadrature, adaptive Gaussian quadrature, Monte Carlo integration, quasi-Monte Carlo integration) will be given. Eighth, we will introduce the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm which can be applied for incomplete-data problems (where the incompleteness can be genuine or conceptual) to obtain maximum likelihood estimates. By applying the EM algorithm, traditionally difficult estimation problems can become fairly straightforward. The general theory of the EM algorithm will be covered and it will be shown how precision estimates can be obtained from it and how its rate of convergence can be improved upon. A general class of optimization methods, to which the EM algorithm belongs, will be introduced.> /> The estimation of the parameters of a statistical model requires the solution of an optimization problem. In a few simple cases, closed-form solutions exist but for many probability models the optimal parameter estimates have to be determined by means of an iterative algorithm. The goal of this course is threefold. First, we want to offer the participants an overview of some frequently used optimization algorithms in (applied) statistics. Second, we want to provide a framework for understanding the connections among several opmization algorithms as well as between optimization and aspects of statistical inference. Third, some important related topics such as numerical differentiation and integration will be covered. In the first part of the course, we start with the presentation of a few motivating examples from statistics that require the optimization of an objective function. Next, we will define the optimization problem in a formal and abstract way and study the necessary and sufficient conditions for its solution. We also discuss some basic tools for tackling optimization problems from multivariate calculus (gradient, Hessian, Taylor series expansion) and from statistics (exponential family). Then it will be shown that in some cases the optimal parameter estimates can be found directly but in other cases an iterative algorithm is needed. In the second part of the course we will explain some basic methods for iteration-based function optimization. We start by illustrating methods for the optimization of functions of one variable and then we turn to the optimization of functions of more than one variable. Several algorithms are presented (Newton-Raphson, quasi-Newton, conjugate gradient, steepest descent, downhill simplex) which differ from each other in the amount of information they use about the surface of the objective function. The advantages and disadvantages of these methods will be illustrated. Because analytical differentiation is not always feasible, we show how numerical differentiation works. An introduction to the field of constrained optimization will be covered too. In a third part we will apply some of the basic algorithms to the important problem of finding maximum likelihood estimates. In this context, an alternative technique, known as Fisher scoring, is available and its use will be illustrated. Next, we discuss the relationship between the maximization of the (log-)likelihood and statistical inference: asymptotical properties of the MLE, estimates of precision, and testing problems. We also consider the iterative proportional fitting algorithm that can be used in multivariate categorical regression settings. In addition, constrained optimization problems and methods to solve them are discussed. In the fourth part of the course, we present some optimization problems which contain an integral that has to be evaluated (linear and generalized linear mixed models). In some cases the integral can be solved analytically but in other cases it has to be approximated numerically. An overview of techniques for numerical integration will be given. In the fifth part, we will introduce the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm which can be applied for incomplete-data problems (where the incompleteness can be genuine or conceptual) to obtain maximum likelihood estimates. By applying the EM algorithm, traditionally difficult estimation problems can become fairly straightforward. The general theory of the EM algorithm will be covered and it will be shown how precision estimates can be obtained from it and how its rate of convergence can be improved upon.> />\n",

      "Numerical problems are frequently encountered by statisticians. Prominently, the estimation of the parameters of a statistical model requires the solution of an optimization problem. In a few simple cases, closed-form solutions exist but for many probability models the optimal parameter estimates have to be determined by means of an iterative algorithm. The goal of this course is threefold. First, we want to offer the readers an overview of some frequently used optimization algorithms in (applied) statistics. Second, we want to provide a framework for understanding the connections among several optimization algorithms as well as between optimization and aspects of statistical inference. Third, although very common, optimization is not the only numerical problem and therefore some important related topics such as numerical differentiation and integration will be covered. Students will learn to apply the theoretical concepts in R.\n",

In each case, a specific type of theoretical problem is approached on a case study basis, and analytic techniques that are specifically suited to deal with that type of theoretical problem are introduced in the context of the case study. The first problem to be addressed concerns the distribution of specific constructions. The way in which a specific construction, like an existential construction or a particular word order pattern, occurs in actual language use is often co-determined by various factors. It is not just the semantics, i.e. what is being expressed, that determines whether a given construction rather than another surfaces, but also the way in which the discourse is organized or the specific (stylistic or sociolinguistic) features of the text may influence the presence of a construction. The theoretical problem to be solved involves the impact of these various factors grammatical, discursive, sociostylistic: how can one disentangle these ? The relevant quantitative technique that we will introduce is logistic regression. The second problem type involves the relationship between language varieties. When we are confronted with differences in language use of a stylistic, sociolinguistic, geographical nature, we will want to determine which language varieties to distinguish exactly: which stylistic levels, for instance, should we distinguish ? And what are the relations that exist between the different dialects of a language ? The techniques that we will introduce to deal with such questions involve measures of the linguistic distance between language varieties (how close are two varieties with regard to each other ?), and multidimensional scaling methods (how do the varieties cluster together ?) With regard to both problem types, the relevant technical apparatus will be introduced in the form of user-friendly computer tools that ensure that the students may apply the techniques independently.\n",

Following this introduction, three-way and multi-way (i.e., multi-dimensional) contingency tables are introduced; also, contemporary statistical notation is introduced at this point, as is the mathematics of probability \"decomposition\" and higher order interactions within multidimensional tables. Logarithms and maximum likelihood estimation are introduced for the log-linear model, followed by the principles of goodness-of-fit testing; alternative methods of hypothesis testing (e.g., chi-square, information criteria) are introduced at this point to permit students to learn alternative approaches to hypothesis testing under varying conditions found in real research settings (e.g., data sparseness, extremely large samples). At this point, substantial emphasis is placed on inference and interpretation of the estimated model parameters. Following the introduction of the log-linear model, attention is turned to models in which one (or more) of the variables is viewed as a dependent variable—the logistic regression model. Substantial attention is given to factors that influence the selection of the appropriate type of logistic model, the proper estimation, and accurate interpretation of parameters estimated under these alternative models. Finally, students are introduced to the logic of models in which one (or more) of the variables is not directly observed—the latent class model. The theory of latent variable modelling is supplemented by multiple examples, so that students can understand the need, and difficulties, associated with estimating, evaluating and interpreting the results of such models.

In CTT, the sum score of a person on a set of items is the main focus of interest. The concepts of reliability and validity of this score are discussed and both factor analysis and item analysis are presented as ways to examine the properties of the sum score and its constituent item scores. In IRT, not the individual’s sum score, but the individual’s item scores are the main focus of interest. Depending on the type of item responses (dichotomous or polytomous) and on the different types of predictors included (characteristics of persons, items, or a combination of persons and items) different IRT models emerge. Several of these models are discussed in more detail. Moreover, the proposed framework for IRT-models is related to the field of generalized (non)linear mixed models.

      "The event-history module starts with one of the earliest methods for the analysis of longitudinal data available: the life table. The life table provides a convenient means to introduce the concepts and terminology used in longitudinal analysis: events, risk sets, state space, duration intervals, person-periods, probabilities and transition rates. The life table subsequently shows data on date-of-event-occurrence or age-at-event-occurrence readily encountered in survey material can be converted to longitudinal duration data on event-occurrence. The measurement of duration data is a key element distinguishing different types of event-history analysis. Both discrete-time methods and semi-parametric or continuous-time methods are developed throughout the module. The complexity of event-history analysis is gradually increased throughout the module. The module starts out with the simplest case: the analysis of a non-repeatable event of a single kind (e.g. death, first job…). For discrete-time event-history analysis the model of logistic regression is treated first as it offers a straightforward means of analysing transition probabilities as a function of covariates when used in combination with a person-period file. The logit model of the discrete-time hazard is subsequently compared with models using alternative link functions, such as the complementary log-log link function. The discrete-time models are subsequently compared to parametric methods for continuous-time data and the (semi-parametric) proportional likelihood model introduced by Cox. Following the analysis of non-repeatable events of a single kind, more complex transitions are considered. A research problem that is frequently encountered in the analysis of longitudinal data is the occurrence of multiple kinds of events (eg. death from different causes, differentiation of the entry into the labour market by type of job…). Multinomial logit models are introduced to analyze competing risks in discrete-time. The concept of ‘type-specific hazard functions’ is introduced on the side of continuous-time models. Subsequently, the basic types of event-history analysis discussed for the analysis of events of a single kind and multiple kinds of events are applied in more complicated ways to analyse repeated events and changes of states. Finally, the module considers frailty and shared frailty models in both discrete and continuous-time. Throughout the module, the different types of models are applied to real-world data on the transition to employment among Turkish and Moroccan immigrants in Belgium, data from the National Databank Mortality on socio-economic mortality differentials as well as data on labour force participation and family formation drawn from retrospective surveys such as the Fertility and Family Surveys (FFS), the European Social Survey (ESS) and the Generations and Gender Survey (GGS).\n",

      "The module on event-history analysis focuses on the longitudinal analysis of time-to-event data. Longitudinal duration data analysed in this module stem from different research designs, ranging from event-histories collected retrospectively in cross-sectoinal surveys to more complex designs such as panel data including time-varying covariates. The module starts out with basic descriptive methods for the analysis of duration data and subsequently considers generalized linear models such as logistic regression and multinomial logit models to develop discrete-time models for the analysis of time-to-event data. Subsequently, descriptive continuous-time methods are developed (e.g. actuarial life tables and Kaplan-Meier estimates of the survivor function) as well as parametric and semi-parametric methods for the analyses of duration data. Advanced topics in the course include the analysis of competing risks, the analysis of repeated events and the modeling of unobserved heterogeneity in hazard models.\n",

      "Thirteen universities (the K.U.Leuven, together with the Universities of Amsterdam, Padua, Oldenburg, Debrecen, Graz, Complutense of Madrid, Lisbon, Tartu, Tubingen, Oulu, and the Internation/Jacobs University of Bremen) from eleven European countries have joined forces to create an EU-funded Intensive Programme on Quantitative Psychology. If you enroll in the course “European seminar on Quantitative psychology”, you may participate in the Intensive Programme. The rationale and objectives of the European seminar are three-fold. (1) In the psychological sciences, many models and theories have been communicated verbally and implicitly. This leads to interpretations that do not permit rigorous testing and falsification hampering communication and progress within as well as across disciplines. Mathematical and computational models on the other hand provide precise qualitative and quantitative predictions offering a rich background for empirical investigations and applications. (2) There is a continuing trend in the psychological sciences to use new and sophisticated research technologies (e.g., dynamical systems theory, Bayesian statistics and model selection, brain imaging). These technological advances are quickly changing how research is conducted and how theoretical models are formulated and tested. These developments also bring about significant changes in the way students need to be taught. (3) There is a need for better understanding of computational models and better training in new research methods and techniques. Students in the psychological sciences require additional mathematical and computational skills to do competitive research on new and emerging topics in the field.\n",

Starting with a simple random intercept random slope model, more complex models are discussed, such as models with multiple and continuous predictors and models for unbalanced data. Particular importance is attached to the interpretation of the output. The main aspects of statistical inference (estimation and testing) are also discussed. The second part focuses on the analysis of experimental designs with repeated measures. We start from the classical univariate analysis model and the possibilities and limitations are explained. Experimental designs with multiple within subject factors, and experimental designs with one within and one between subject factor are discussed. The third part discusses logistic regression. Starting from motivating examples, an introduction to generalized linear models is presented. Special attention is paid to the interpretation of regression coefficients in a logistic regression model. Statistical inference for a logistic regression model is explored. Practica content The practica focus on: learning R-getting experience with the application of the basic concepts, through computational and small data-based exercises using R. mastering the practice of data analysis (including exploration of the data, choosing a technique, conducting the analysis, interpreting the results and communicating the results) through a large data assignment.

      "This course is about project management and scheduling. Planning and scheduling are decision-making processes that occur in many manufacturing and service industries. In this course we study planning and scheduling processes mainly from a project viewpoint, but the principles and methodologies of this project scheduling are also applicable in a production environment. The course consists of two parts. Part I (Project scheduling) deals with project systems, which involve activities to be performed in a production or service environment, by following given precedence relationships with or without additional resource constraints. The planning phase of a project involves a listing of tasks or jobs that must be performed to bring about the project’s completion. Gross requirements for material, equipment, and manpower are also determined in this phase, and estimates of durations and costs for the various jobs are made. We will study the use of activity-on-the-arc and activity-on-the-node networks to represent the projects to be planned. Scheduling is the laying out of the actual jobs of the project in the time order in which they have to be performed. Manpower and material requirements needed at each stage of production are calculated along with the expected completion time of each of the jobs. Control begins with reviewing the difference between the schedule and actual performance once the project has begun. The analysis and correction of this difference forms the basic aspects of control. The main topics discussed in Part I can be listed as follows: project representation using activity networks, time analysis (estimating the project duration in a deterministic and probabilistic setting), resource management, i.e. resource leveling (leveling the use of the resources over time subject to a project deadline) and resource-constrained-project scheduling (scheduling the activities subject to the various precedence and resource constraints in order to minimize the project duration), cash flow management (scheduling a project in order to maximize its net present value), time/cost trade-off problems (taking corrective actions in order to bring a project back to plan), project scheduling under risk and proactive/reactive project scheduling (protecting the baseline schedule to anticipate possible schedule disruptions that may occur during project execution, and the deployment of reactive procedures to repair the schedule when it breaks despite the built-in protection). Part II (Project management) deals with the generally recognized good practices of project management. In this part, the application of knowledge, skills, tools and techniques to project activities in order to meet the project requirements will be discussed and this along the five important phases in a project, namely initiating the project, planning the project, executing the project, monitoring and controlling the project, and closing the project.\n",

      "The course can be divided into four main thematic sections: Stochastic discounting . In this part we review the development of the Stochastic Discount Factor. In particular, we start from the standard deterministic discounting technique and show how general equilibrium Euler equations allow us to extend the main idea of deterministic discounting to stochastic discounting. This stochastic discounting technique allows in principle to price all assets. Standard financial concepts such as the risk-free rate, the mean-variance frontier, the Sharpe ratio and others are introduced and interpreted within this basic SDF framework. Arbitrage Pricing Theories . In this part of the course we show that the SDF model does not depend on the exact equilibrium pricing model. Instead, SDF representations follow from imposing the absence of arbitrage opportunities. We introduce a formal definition of arbitrage opportunities and show that the absence of arbitrage implies the existence of a linear pricing function (the SDF). Within this theory we discuss the concepts of (in)complete markets, contingent claims and Arrow Debreu prices. While the development of the no-arbitrage theory is rather abstract we also provide the more practical market models that are implied by the no-arbitrage approach. In particular, we show how the standard CAPM model, the APT model and the Fama-French factor representation all follow as special cases of the Arbitrage Pricing Theories. Finally, we discuss the analysis of dynamic trading startegies Macro-Finance theories . In this part of the course we return to the equilibrium interpretation of the SDF and try to identify it in terms of macroeconomic quantities. This macroeconomic interpretation is not pursued in relative pricing models such as CAPM, APT or Fama-French and requires additional structure. In particular, we focus on risk attitudes (Arrow-Pratt) measures of risk and intertemporal rate of substitution as implied by specific types of utility functions. A practical implication of the above framework is represented by a set of Macro-Finance theories, explaining financial prices based on macroeconomic developments. We will discuss some benchmark models as well as the well-known asset pricing puzzles. Empirical analysis . Most of the analysis in the previous parts is theoretical in nature. In the last part of this course we focus on the practical and the empirical implications of the SDF theory. In particular, we focus on the main implication of SDF: under risk aversion some predictability should be present in financial markets (in the form of risk premia). We analyze bond, stock and exchange rate markets and identify the type of predictability implied by the data. Several time series models will be used in this part. /\n",
      "\n",
      "The course provides an in-depth analysis of price formation on financial markets. Within this framework, a pivotal role is played by the 'Fundamental Theorem of Finance' which implies the existence of a Stochastic Discount Factor (SDF) in a no-arbitrage environment. This SDF can be used to generate standard equilibrium pricing theories for, among others, stocks, bonds and exchange rates. The main goals of this course are to (i) introduce the SDF approach to finance (ii) develop equilibrium pricing models for the different financial markets (stock, bonds and exchange rates) (iii) provide macro-finance theories of the stock and bond markets and (iv) discuss the empirical implications and evidence of these price theories. Upon completion of this course, the student is able to: understand the main financial theories (CAPM, Fama-French, Risk Neutral Pricing, Arrow-Debreu pricing) and in particular the role of systemic versus idiosyncratic risk factors in asset pricing use the above mentioned theories in assessing the impact of different types of fundamental (macro) factors (shocks) on financial markets apply the pricing methods in the analysis of specific and practical pricing problems of bonds, stocks and especially standard derivative products\n",

An SDI is a set of technological and non-technological components meant to facilitate access, exchange and re-use of geospatial data within and between organisations with a view to contributing to the spatial enablement and performance of all kinds of user processes. In this course, SDI are studied as multi-component adaptive systems. Emphasis is given to the management and user perspective on SDI . Through the course students will: Acquire thorough knowledge of the rationale and concepts of Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDI); Acknowledge the organizational dimension of SDI; Acquire thorough knowledge of the technical components of SDI: (i) geospatial data repositories, (ii) metadata catalogues, (iii) access services and (iv) technical standards regarding (i), (ii) and (iii); Learn to interact with SDI to discover, explore and exploit geodatasets; Work with geospatial databases and SQL; Learn how to contribute to SDI through data modelling and standardization, metadata compilation, service development.\n",

In this chapter, we will also see the importance of the kramers-kronig relation applied to the susceptibility of optical materials along with so-called conformal transformations.2- The special functions that are Bessel functions and Hermite polynomials: what is their origin, their properties and why they are important in photonics.3- Numerical techniques used in practice to simulate photonic systems: describing the main fundamental concepts of each, along with their advantages and drawbacks. The main goal here being to provide all information required to choose the most efficient method for a given problem considering its specificities.4- The impact of symmetries and periodicities in photonic systems: detailing the effect of symmetries and periodicities on the system behaviour and how they could be exploited in practice e.g. in photonic crystals.5- Dynamical behaviour of photonic systems: in this part, a short introduction to the much wider topic of nonlinear dynamics will be given. The course covers the basic concepts of dynamical systems, steady-states and periodic orbits first for 1D and 2D discrete maps before extending to continuous systems. Saddle points and chaos will also be quickly covered.\n",

      "All businesses and individuals make use, directly or indirectly, of (micro)electronics technology and ICT. Since the invention of the transistor in 1947 and the invention of the integrated circuit in 1958, all of these domains have undergone a significant (r)evolution. In this course we will examine some of the important industrial dynamics that accompany such (r)evolution. Photonics is a technology that is applied in wide range of industrial sectors. Several of these industries are presently witnessing exponential growth: solar cells, LCD displays, (Organic) Light Emitting Diodes, industrial and night vision, telecommunications… Flanders and the VUB can boast world class researcher groups in this domain, and many Belgian firms (established and startups) are active in the application domains mentioned above. The course consists of several parts:The first part introduces the students to the basic concepts of high-technology entrepreneurship and business, including technology transfer. After this, we consider the relevant industries, business models, current and future developments and the role of regulations, standards and government in the industry. We then turn to firm-specific topics such as commercialization, financial management, business development and IPR strategy.Importantly, not only the characteristics of mature companies are covered, but more so the relevant aspects of young, starting companies. A number of photonics-related business cases are studied and relevant guest speakers are invited.\n",

The course serves a twofold purpose. First it tries to give an overview of the different physical mechanisms through which the optical sensor changes the characteristics of a light signal by allowing it to interact with a physical measurand. We therefore review the most important characteristics of an optical signal, the principles of interferometry, the Bragg condition and the elastooptic effect. Second, it describes how optical sensors are built, what their main specifications are and which aspects one has to consider for building an effective sensor. Both free space optical sensors and optical fiber sensors are investigated: Free space sensors are applied to the measurement of distance and displacement; speed and acceleration; and temperature. Optical fiber point sensors based on interferometry, Bragg gratings or distributed sensors are compared and the potential of multiplexing is studied.\n",

      "ContentThis course describes the various steps one has to go through for obtaining a linear dynamic model of a process. It starts with the choice (design) of the measurement setup, the choice (design) of the excitation signal, the choice of the parametric model (discrete time, continuous time, parametric versus non-parametric noise model...), the estimation of the parametric model (identification toolboxes in Matlab), till finally the model selection and the model validation. Hereby the influence of each error source (stochastic measurement errors, systematic measurement errors, non-linear distortions, time-variant effects, model errors...) on the final result is studied in detail.Each step is illustrated thoroughly by means of real life examples.The course starts with the basic techniques necessary to predict the stochastic behaviour of an estimator (consistency, bias, efficiency, probability density function, robustness). Furthermore, the continuous thread throughout the entire course is the formulation of the maximum likelihood solution starting from the measured data. This approach has the advantage that provides the estimated model with an estimate of its uncertainty.Contents Preliminary Example Nonparametric Models of LTI Systems Parametric Models of LTI Systems Improved Nonparametric Models for LTI Systems Estimation Parametric Plant Model with Known Noise Model Estimation Parametric Plant Model with Estimated Nonparametric Noise Model Estimation Parametric Plant and/or Noise Models Guidelines Take Home Messages Books on system identificationAimsAfter following this course, the student should be able to solve independently an identification problem. More particularly, the student should be able to: Choose an appropriate measurement setup for a given identification problem (prediction/control or physical interpretation). Design an excitation signal for measuring simultaneously in a given frequency band the dynamic behaviour of a system, the noise level, the level of the nonlinear distortions, and time variant effects. Select and validate a model (discrete- or continuous-time, dynamic order) from noisy input, noisy output observations. Select an appropriate estimator for a particular identification problem. Analyse and interpret critically measurement and identification results. Make a motivated choice between non-parametric and parametric noise models.In addition, the student must have acquired insight into: The importance and use of the following asymptotic properties of an estimator: consistency, asymptotic bias, asymptotic efficiency, robustness, and asymptotic normality. The importance and use of the (strong) law of large numbers, and the central limit theorem for proving the asymptotic properties of an estimator. The important steps in the proof of the asymptotic properties of an estimator. The problems that arise when the input signal is not known exactly and the possible solutions. The difficulties of identifying dynamical systems operating in closed loop, and the possible solutions.\n",

      "General goal of the course Engineers and scientists build models to understand, describe, predict and control the behaviour of the environment. In order to create these models it is necessary to combine the mathematical models with (noisy) measurements. In this advanced course, we will explore the consequences of having systems which do not satisfy the basic assumptions made when making frequency response function measurements. That is, we will learn how to deal with nonlinearities and time variations. Also, an introduction is given to the measurement of very high frequency signals and systems, and to the use of recursive identification techniques. In addition to a sound theoretical basis, we will also provide the students with hand on experiences in the labs. Short outline Measuring high frequency signals and systems Taking into account time variations and nonlinear distortions Use of recursive identification, and the Kalman filter (state estimation) Study Material Lecture notes are available that cover the complete material, including the labs.

This course introduces the concepts and techniques of quantum field theory using a realistic theory: quantum electrodynamics (QED). This is the theory which provides a microscopic description of electrically charged particles interacting through the electro-magnetic force.After introducing the free Maxwell and Dirac fields, interactions are introduced in a systematic way. The full theory is then treated using time dependent perturbation theory - translated in the form of Feynman diagrams and rules.Subsequently we use this to analyze several standard processes in QED: pair production, scattering in an external field, Compton scattering, ...Next radiative corrections are studied thereby introducing the concepts of regularization and renormalization. The course ends with a brief introduction to the generalization of QED to the other fundamental interactions.\n",

      "This course discusses techniques to design, document, implement, and evaluate the architecture of large-scale software systems and integrations thereof. We start with the role of architecture in the software engineering process, and the different perspectives from which and the stakeholders for which it needs to be defined. For each perspective, we discuss architectural patterns that have proven themselves in successful software systems. We illustrate these patterns using architectural frameworks in the programming language Scala where possible, of which the relevant features are reviewed at the beginning of the course. Next we shift our attention from architectural patterns in general, to design patterns for micro-service architectures in particular. These help realise important quality attributes such as fault tolerance and scalability. Finally, we review metrics to assess the quality of an implemented architecture with respect to maintainability and evolvability. Table of contents: 1.

      "This course concerns the development of advanced web information systems, i.e., information systems that use web technology to provide new types of functionality or make existing types of information systems more effective. The core topics in this course are as follows: Advanced Content Management Systems: Advanced web-sites with complex and dynamic content are better developed and managed using a Content Management System such as Drupal. The course investigates the use and functionality of such systems. Model-based Web-Development: Web-sites that offer do not only offer content but also functionality are complex to program and can therefore benefit from a model-based approach where much of the code is generated from models that describe the desired functionality. The course discusses the standards for this and tools to support this approach. Responsive Web Design: Developing Web Applications that are responsive, i.e., adapt their layout to the device they are accessed from in order to improve the user interaction with a particular application. Search Engine Optimization: When developing web-sites and web-applications that need to attract attention, it is important to ensure that they are readily found by search engines. The course looks at techniques to maximize the probability that a site appears high in the result of important search engines. Crowdsourcing: The Web makes it possible to delegate certain tasks that are not easily solved by algorithms to so-called crowds, which can be users of an information system, visitors of a web site or other users of the Web who are somehow convinced to participate. This can in many case make tasks feasible that are not solvable by computers alone. The course looks at existing techniques to involve users in computational tasks and ways of involving them and making sure that the results they produce are trustworthy. Other topics: Additional topics may be introduced during the course on the basis of expressed interest.\n",

By having an in-depth understanding of the query-optimization-and-execution pipeline, one becomes more proficient in administring DBMSs, and hand-optimizing SQL queries for fast execution.Topics studied in transaction processing include logging, serializability, concurrency control, and their combination.\n",

      "Retrieving relevant information is one of the central activities in modern knowledge-driven societies. As the amount and variety of data increase at an unprecedented rate, access to relevant, possibly unstructured information is becoming more and more challenging. The World Wide Web is now the primary source of information for leisure and work activities. The real value of the Web can only be unlocked if the huge amount of available data can be found, analysed, and exploited so that each user can quickly find information that is both relevant and comprehensive for their needs.Information Retrieval (IR) is the discipline that deals with the representation, storage, organisation of, and access to information items, and it is concerned with providing efficient access to large amounts of unstructured contents, such as text, images, videos etc. The objective of the IN4325 - Information Retrieval course is to introduce the scientific underpinnings of the field of Information Retrieval. The course aims at providing students basic information retrieval concepts and more advanced techniques for efficient data processing, storage, and querying. Students are also provided with a rich and comprehensive catalogue of information search tools that can be exploited in the design and implementation of Web and Enterprise search engines.The following topics are covered: Basic IR Models (boolean, vector-based, probabilistic); Basic Indexing Techniques; Term Weighting and Scoring; Web Search; Relevance Feedback and Query Expansion; Semantic Search Information Seeking Paradigms Evaluation of information retrieval systems\n",

Students are acquainted with complex object models, concurrency models, distribution models, service discovery and failure handling techniques.The course also exposes students to reflection and meta-level programming since these techniques have always played an important part in distributed programming. The course shows how these techniques can be used to implement important concurrency and distribution abstractions such as conditional synchronisation, futures, leased references, tuple spaces, peer-to-peer algorithms. The course teaches a number of fundamental results in distributed algorihtms such as the FLT theorem, CAP theorem and their implications. Other fundamental topics are synchronization, agreement and replication. The course teaches a number of modern technological advancements such as RFID-technology, IoT, mobile-cross platform technology, and Complex-Event Processing.

      "As the computer industry has grown over the last 50 years, the focal point has often been performance. Machines have gotten faster and faster, smaller and smaller. We have much larger and more complex pieces of software now than we did 40 years ago. This course will be about de-mystifying how to evaluate and analyze the performance of computer programs, particularly those written in managed languages. We will look at the software stack, and discuss how each of the layers -- the application, the compiler, the (potential) runtime environment, the operating system, the processor, and the memory system -- all impact the end performance of a program. We will look at some tools that shed light on why a program gets the execution time it does - analyzing its memory behavior or in what methods the bottlenecks might be. These are profiling or performance monitoring tools that are relatively easy to use to analyze performance. We will talk about metrics and statistics - once you run a program or a suite of programs, how do you accurately present and summarize results about their performance? Finally, we will touch on how the multicore era has also influenced the industry, and talk about the opportunities and limitations programming in parallel bring to performance. We will include a discussion on heterogeneous hardware, as well, and how some computer architects have modeled these machines to help design future processors. The following list of topics will be discussed: The software stack Superscalar and out-of-order processors, at a high level The memory subsystem and how memory is laid out, caches Performance tools such as perf to obtain hardware performance counters Details of managed language runtime environments (like the Java virtual machine) and how they impact performance Garbage collection algorithms Dynamic compilation and profiling Statistics and how to present results - which means to use and how to do confidence intervals. Parallelism: Amdahl's Law, Gustafson's Law, speedup and scalability Analytical model of processors, superscalar pipeline, simulators Multicores: chip multiprocessors (CMPs) and heterogeneous machinesOf the layers of the software/system stack, we will focus more on the runtime environment and memory system than other layers. We will touch on details about adaptive or dynamic compilers that are used in managed runtime environments. We will also discuss processors and how they execute instructions. Understanding how they work at a high level helps to understand how an application achieves the performance it does. Also, the memory system is clearly linked to the processor and has a huge impact on overall performance. So we will focus on how caches are laid out and used, and how a runtime environment lays out memory and reclaims dead memory. To gather information about the hardware's behavior, we will explore hardware performance counters, and use tools that can read them and summarize results from them.Two important aspects of analyzing performance are 1) how to properly set up experiments to measure and evaluate what you want to show, and 2) how to present results if you do perform experiments. We will discuss proper experimental methodology (for Java applications), such as how to eliminate non-determinism and exploring the space-time tradeoff of garbage collection. I will also teach good practices on how to repeat experiments and take averages over a set of results, and present confidence intervals in graphs.Finally, we will explore a bit of how parallel programming affects performance. We'll assume a shared-memory model. We will discuss speedup and Amdahl's Law and Gustafson's law. We'll talk a little about cache coherence and false sharing. We'll talk a bit about the OS's job scheduling tasks. We will also talk briefly about the hardware reordering instructions and memory consistency, if time allows. We will also touch on power as a prime concern, which led to the rise of heterogeneous machines.\n",

The students will also obtain a basic understanding of (evolutionary) game theory which will allow them to understand the standard literature in that field and the relevance of this domain to learning in general.The students will obtain the skills to address independently problems within these fields.In addition, they will be capable of presenting their work to an audience of specialists and non-specialists.The course addresses two general areas of research : individual-based learning and social learning in populations.The first part focusses on learning through experience, of which reinforcement learning is the standard example. We start from simple single agent reinforcement learning (stateless RL) which we extent to deal with the interplay of multiple learning agents in the same environment. For this purpose and for the following part on evolutionary dynamics, basic concepts of Game Theory are introduced.The second part provides an introduction to the principles of learning by imitation, modeled through evolutionary dynamics. It will explain what evolution is and how games can be used to model interactions between individuals in a population. It will show how these models can be used to study the evolution of cooperation in social dilemmas, the evolution of conventions like language or even the dynamics of cancer.

Specific properties and preprocessing of biomedical signals (EEG, ECG, ...) are analysed. An important part of the course deals with medical imaging: techniques, physical principles, imaging models, instruments. - Nuclear imaging: physical principles (photon production mechanisms, interactions of photons with materials); Monte-Carlo simulations in medical imaging; instruments (collimators, detectors; gamma camera, PET imaging; SPECT imaging) - Radiology: imaging in conventional radiology; production of X-rays; X-ray spectrum; CT scanner principles; image reconstruction (mathematical framework, reconstruction algorithms, reconstruction artifacts); digital radiology (subtraction techniques based on contrast agents and dual energy techniques); vizualization of CT scans. - Magnetic Resonance Imaging, MRI: physical principles, imaging (spatial encoding: slice selection, frequency and phase encoding, signal detection, Fourier reconstruction, sampling), pulse sequences, recent developments (e.g. high acquisition speed techniques). Medical image processing is the second main part of the course. The basic principles of a number of essential image processing techniques are described. Emphasis goes to aspects that are primarily important for medical images: image enhancement, image visualization (including 3D visualization), segmentation and labeling of images (i.e. delineation and recognition of anatomical entities in medical images, like MRI and CT) and image fusion (geometrical registration of images acquired with the same modality - e.g. CT-CT, or acquired with different modalities - e.g. PET-CT). The principles and techniques are illustrated with demonstrations (e.g. 3D visualization of medical images) and with case-studies based on the results of research projects. - Perception of images and specific characteristics of medical images - An introduction to multidimensional signal processing - Image enhancement techniques - Image segmentation - Image fusion, matching and image registration - Image visualization The course material is supported by practical exercises on digital signal and image processing and a hospital visit.

Part II revolves around sampling, quantisation and transformations. The first chapter of this part will cover the Shannon-Nyquist sampling theorem and A/D – D/A conversion (these fundamental principles will however be challenged later in Part IV). The next chapters in Part II while revolve around the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and its fast implementation (namely, the FFT) as well as around quantisation topics. After a brief recap on the Laplace and the Z-transform, Part III will cover the design of digital filters (both FIR and IIR) as well as fixed point effects in filters. Finally, Part IV will describe advanced topics in digital signal processing, including multirate DSP theory and systems.

      "The course 'Parallel Systems' consists of a theoretical and a practical part. The theoretical part consists of 10 lectures, of which the first and the last are the most important since they discuss the course’s philosophy. The practical part consists of 6 practical sessions and a programming project. During the practical sessions, the constructs for multithreading and message-passing in java are explored. The programming project happens in groups of 2 to 3 persons. The design of simple, generic and performant parallel programs relies on deep insight in all aspects of modern hardware and software technology. The course therefore offers a wider scope than just dealing with the 'parallel issues'. 1. Overview of Parallel Systems Parallel systems constitute of processors that are connected in some way. They are more present than ever. Parallel processing is the only answer to the ever-increasing demand for more computational power. Nowadays, the big giants in hardware and software, like Intel and Microsoft, are increasingly aware of it and have pounced onto the market. This chapter presents an overview and explains why parallel resources are not for free. 2. Shared-memory paradigm: Multithreading Multiprocessors are becoming the standard in PCs. They allow for multithreaded parallel programs, which are based on the shared-memory paradigm. In this chapter all aspects are discussed that should be taken into consideration when creating multi-threaded applications. Besides an overview we will focus on the Java constructs. 3. Message-passing paradigm: MPI Processors that do not have access to each other's memory communicate by sending messages to each other. This is called the message-passing paradigm, of which MPI is the leading standard. It is discussed how MPI should be used and MPI is compared to more special parallel languages. 4. GPU computingAccelerators such as GPUs offer a tremendous amount of computational power. But such power comes at the expense of the necessary reimplementation of your code and optimization of the code towards the underlying architecture.5. Performance Analysis of Parallel Processing The main goal of parallel processing is shortening the runtime of programs. This chapter presents the performance analysis or parallel programs.6. Dense Matrix Algorithms Parallelization of matrix algorithms can happen in different ways. The, sometimes subtle, differences give us the opportunity to dig deeper in the various issues involved with parallel processing. 7. Discrete Optimization Problems More advanced issues in parallel processing can be discussed with the parallelization of discrete optimization problems. 9. Conclusions Wrap-up of the course. The discussion of the introduction are reconsidered.Finally, we list the main differences of this course with the course 'Multicore Programming' taught by Tom Van Cutsem. Parallel Systems taught by Jan Lemeire (1) Focuses on low-level approaches to parallel computing. (2) Discusses the well-established techniques for message-passing and multithreading which have proven their value. Standard thread creation and synchronization is treated in-depth, showing the threats of this technique to the student. (3) Concentrates on scientific computing, such as algorithms allowing data-parallelism (‘regular concurrency’), although all applications can be parallelized with the techniques. Focus on dedicated parallel algorithms. (4) Discusses the current trend of using GPUs for high-performance computing. Multicore Programming taught by Jennifer Sartor (1) Focuses on high-level approaches to concurrent programming. (2) Discusses cutting-edge, innovative, scientific approaches. Considers alternative approaches to multithreading, since standard multithreading is not scalable and not robust. (3) Focuses on concurrent applications with irregular concurrency, distributed systems, influence of concurrency on software architecture. Focus on parallelizing existing software. (4) Discusses important parallel software patterns such as Google’s mapreduce.\n",

      "The workshop is built around the use of the hydrologic simulator SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool). SWAT consists of a semi-distributed hydrologic rainfall-runoff model and hydrologic river and reservoir routing models, as well as erosion, sediment transport and diffuse pollution wash-off modules. The simulator is also suited to analyse the impact of alternative management (soil, vegetation, irrigation) and climate change scenario's. In a first stage, the students have to learn about modelling problems in general. To this purpose, lectures will be organised, dealing with the classification and the use of models, data assessment problems and model calibration and evaluation. Also, a general introduction of the SWAT simulator will be provided. The students will then be subdivided into working groups in order to apply SWAT on a given river basin. A SWAT model will be developed, calibrated and applied to analyse the impact of land use change scenario's on the hydrologic response, erosion and water quality for a real river basin. The application results will be presented and discussed in plenary sessions.\n",

      "The course is composed of five parts. Part 1 Fundamentals of the design of structures in reinforced concrete This part starts with a short overview of design methods: elastic design, method using partial safety factors, probabilistic design and failure design. Next, the design loads are identified. This includes fundamental aspects on the identification of structural schemes and the performance of structural analysis of structures in reinforced concrete. Finally, material behavior is discussed, with the identification of the design values. Part 2 Basic theory of design of beams in reinforced concrete This part first focuses on the determination of the main reinforcement in reinforced concrete sections in the Ultimate Limit State (ULS), and on the verification of sections in the Serviceability Limit State (SLS): verification of stress levels and simplified criteria for avoiding unacceptable crack opening and deformation. Practical detailing of reinforcement is also discussed. Next, attention is paid to the design for shear, with analysis of shear strength of members without and with shear reinforcement and to the detailing of shear reinforcement. Finally, fundamentals about crack opening are presented in view of the introduction of the simplified model for deflection calculation. Part 3 Design of slabs This part is limited to the design of one-way, two-way and continuous slabs by means of simplified design methods (Marcus, Czerny). Attention is paid to the practical detailing of reinforcement and the torsion problem in corners. The equivalent framework method for flat slab design is discussed and is complemented by an introduction to the punching shear design problem. Finally, the strip method is presented as a versatile tool for solving various design problems: openings in slabs, concentrated loads, complex shapes and boundary conditions. Part 4 Design of columns This part is limited to the determination of the sensitivity of columns for buckling and to the detailing of reinforcement in columns. Buckling analysis is not part of this course. Part 5 Strut and tie method This part presents the strut and tie method for the design of walls, foundation blocs, deep beams, corbels and all regions with discontinuity in geometry or actions.\n",

      "Today, virtually all designers, architects, architectural or civil engineers operating in the built environment are directly or indirectly confronted with the concept of sustainability. Sustainable design requires a holistic view, which takes all aspects into account that are of influence on the complete life cycle of constructions, their constitutive components and the materials they are made of, not neglecting the urban scale on which they operate. Taking responsibility for one’s designs and the way they behave in and interact with the built environment - now and in the future - is a key aspect.‘Entities’ (urban fragments, constructions, components) which are required to be of use here and now, but also in a future (unknown) scenario, have to be provided with an adaptive or transformational capacity. Transformation of structures for architectural and structural engineering applications is generally accomplished by one of two means: by incorporating a kinematic mechanism into the structure or by conceiving the construction as a kit-of-parts system.Designing a structural mechanism leads to what is commonly known as a ‘deployable structure’, allowing an instant transformation from a compact state to an expanded, deployed configuration, in which it is ready for use. Examples are exhibition pavilions, emergency tents, stage covers for festivals, or even large retractable roofs for sports stadia.Designing a kit of parts system requires that the structure can be partly or completely dismantled into its components, after which it can be rebuilt, allowing the structure to adapt to changing circumstances. Key concepts are compatibility and re-use of components. This course focusses on gaining knowledge and insight in some aspects of sustainable design and transformable structures: the necessary concepts, methodologies, tools and techniques are taught. Digital parametric design tools (Rhinoceros 3D + plugin Grasshopper) are taught and by means of intermediate exercises it is shown how these can be used for the design and the evaluation of a transformable concept. As a final assignment the student is expected to be able to apply this knowledge by himself in a design project, thereby demonstrating insight, creativity and critical reflection. The developed concept operates on one or several of four levels: material, component, structure or urban scale.\n",

A second one is relevant to architecture and involves, on one hand, the in depth study of a building within the Master Plan, “targeted project “, and on the other hand its technical aspects and choice of materials, the “detailed project” (second semester, DESIGN STUDIO SUSTAINABLE DESIGN b)Global objectives of the studio: to create a sustainable architectural and urban complex organism, which entails: Learn the questioning and taking attitude in regards to the elements at stake of a program and a site within the general context of Sustainable Development. Learn to apprehend the composition of such complex organism integrating various (apparently disparate) functions from which one ought to create a coherent spatial organization in relation with its more general urban context. Learn how to manage left-over spaces generated by the site’s numerous structures. Learn how to question the potential of existing structures in regards to their capacity in supporting or developing a more comprehensive urban regeneration and the urban densification in response to the territorial factors within the sustainable vision at every scale (city, district and building scales down to materials and systems.) Learn how to implement various aspects of environmentally friendly approaches to urban design and architecture according to different trends and visions (bioclimatic, sustainability, C2C…). Learn how to question and implement different materials, technologies, techniques and building methods in order to promote a positive action on the human environment and learn how to prioritize and achieve the goals (Health, well being, natural resources, energy, water, soil, biodiversity, social issues…) within the very context of the chosen project. Study the influence of those choices on the creation of living spaces a turban and building scales.\n",

For each topic four approaches are used: (1) dynamic energy balance modelling (2) innovation by research (3) technological aspects and specification texts (4) economic aspects. EnergyPlus is used for dynamic energy balance modelling. An overview of the deliverables of recent European research projects is available. Technological aspects are introduced through technical data sheets and catalogues of manufacturers of building systems and components. The European cost-optimal strategy for nearly zero-energy buildings is used to evaluate the economic aspects. Students should select two topics, and are asked to integrate the four approaches into an individual case study. The course is organised in 5 lectures and 5 studio work sessions in which an individual case study is analysed. Energy and water monitoring equipment is available for individual checks.

In the 3-credit course, the focus of the project will lie on either the application of new form finding methods, or the advanced application of known form finding methods, and their creative combination with optimisation methods.\n",

      "Position of the course The aim of the course is to present students an overview of all steps required to solve a biomedical problem by designing a product prototype and considering the first steps of the business development process. Students will be taught how to apply a methodical way of designing a product, which should lead to enhanced product quality. By creating several possible solutions to a problem the chance to find the optimal solution is enlarged. All parts of the methodical design process will be practiced as group assignments (groups of 4 to 6 students). Since group work is very important part of product development, this will also be taught and practiced. In addition, lectures will be given on aspects of intellectual property rights (patenting), quality assessment and assurance, patient safety regulations, business development. Will also include presentations and testimonies from relevant guest lecturers. Contents Designing biomedical products requires a specific methodical design process because of the diversity of the stakeholders, the different background of the project participants, the limitation of the amount of background information, and the complexity of the working environment.

      "Position of the courseIn a report of the World Health Organization from 2006, neurological disorders contribute to 6.3% of the global burden of disease. This report estimates that the number of healthy life years lost because of neurological disorders will increase from 92 million in 2005 to 103 million in 2030, approximately a 12% increase mainly due to the aging population. Hence, there is still an important interest in neuroscience research to study the brain under normal and pathological conditions, even though, therapeutic successes have been few. Especially translational aims have been a remarkable engine for driving research investment in the neurosciences. Translational neuroscience is defined as:1. Experimental non-human and non-clinical (basic science) studies conducted with the specific intent to discover mechanisms, biomarkers, pathogenesis or treatments of nervous system disorders; and2. Clinical studies that provide a foundation for developing, or that directly test, novel therapeutic strategies for humans with nervous system disorders.In other words, translational neuroscience will bring basic preclinical knowledge (from the bench) to clinical practice (to the bedside) to expand understanding of brain structure, function and disease, and translate this knowledge into clinical applications and novel therapies of nervous system disorders. Thus, translational neuroscience is the process of using all technological advances to bring novel therapies with measurable outcomes to patients with neurological diseases. In this course, emphasis will be on translational neuroimaging, where multiple imaging techniques are used to bridge the gap between preclinical research and clinic practice. These imaging methods need to fulfil certain criteria such as being non-invasive (MRI), or at least minimal invasive (PET), and providing quantitative information to simplify the process of translating preclinical findings into the clinic.Contents· The importance of small animal imaging· Multimodal neuroimaging· Setting up a small animal experiment· Animal models· Opto-genetics· Chemo-genetics· Computing for the characterization of neurodegenerative disorders· Examples of translational neuroscience experiments at our university\n",

The relations between microstructure and macroscopic properties are focused. The most important analytical techniques for the characterization of ‘structure-property relations’ are treated. The course contains three major parts: macromolecular structure, supramolecular structure, and macroscopic polymer properties. (i) Chain constitution and architecture, molar mass and molar mass distribution, chain conformations and chain statistics, influence of polymerisation on the macromolecular structure. (ii) Link between microstructure and material properties: amorphous and crystalline phases, phase separation, crystallinity, morphology, networks, chain mobility, temperature-time superposition principle. (iii) Material properties of important polymer classes (thermoplastics, thermosets, elastomers, thermoplastic elastomers, polymer blends and (nano)composites): thermal behaviour, energy-elasticity and entropy-elasticity, mechanical, electrical and optical properties. The most important characterization methods are: molar mass determination, thermal analysis, infrared and Raman spectroscopy, optical and electron microscopy, NMR spectroscopy, X-ray analysis, and mechanical testing. In the practicals, the theoretical content of the course is illustrated by means of the experimental characterization of both pre-defined as well as unknown polymer materials.\n",

These systems of equations will then be applied in a second stage to the modeling of different types of systems, e.g. liquid films flowing along inclined planes, non-isothermal and variable-composition flows and their hydrodynamic instabilities, flows in the presence of phase change (evaporation, absorption, solidification), … Analytical techniques and approximations for solving these systems of equations will be used, together with numerical methods (commercial CFD software) in order to solve concrete problemsIn the second part, the students will be introduced to the most important elements of solid/gas, heterogeneous catalysis and fluid/fluid reactor design. This will be done by first establishing dedicated expressions for the overall process kinetics, which will subsequently be applied in reactor design equations established based on the knowledge acquired in the first part.

Aspects such as catalyst deactivation and regeneration, integration of separation and reaction, material synthesis, pore size assessment, kinetics of reaction, diffusion in porous media, shape selective catalysis etc are dealt with. Relationships between effects at the molecular level and the process scale are discussed.During the lab sessions, several aspects of catalysis as discussed during the course are assessed experimentally. For example, a particular zeolite is studied in detail. For this material, both adsorption and kinetic properties are studied. Adsorption isotherms are obtained via batch experiments, while separation of gas mixtures is studied in breakthrough experiments. The activity in a selected reaction (e.g. alkylation) of the catalyst is studied. Based on the experimental data, kinetic and adsorption parameters have to be calculated. At the end of the lab session, a written report has to be handed in.This should allow the student to understand catalytic processes, which form the core of chemical industry, and to contribute to the development and/or optimization of catalytic processes.\n",

StaquetSet of conferences in the field of the structural engineering in Belgium and in Europe: What is the link between the use of the materials and the structural shape? How to optimize the structural shape and design ?3 days-trip abroad in Europe (including visits of constructions with interest from a civil engineering point of view (buildings, bridges, tunnels, barrier, ect…).Oral presentation and written report on one construction of interest in civil engineering scheduled in the trip. Part 2 : Structural Engineering and Geotechnical Project (0-0-9 ECTS)Part 2.1 : Structural Engineering Coordination: L. PylThe assignment is to analyze, in a team, a mid-rise concrete building. This structural analysis process consists of the following steps:- Preliminary design: choice of the lay-out of the structural elements (direction of the spans, the beams and distance between columns; pre-design of slabs, beams and columns; visualization of the structure by plans (plan view, sections, wireframe views) and eventually a structural 3D mock up.- Structural analysis:Determination of loads and combinations using EC1, making calculation hypothesis and a static modelStructural analysis using analytical methodsIf necessary, verification of the dynamic behaviour of the structure- Dimensioning of the structure according to the Eurocodes, including the slabs, the beams, the columns and the central core- Detailing of some important structural parts, including the reinforcement calculations- Written and oral reportingIn order to support the structural design process, several theoretical classes are given, that can depend from project to project (a.o. introduction to structural design, calculation of wind loads and horizontal stability of structures, ...). Part 2.2 : Geotechnical EngineeringCoordination: P. GérardThe objective of the geotechnical part of the project is to design the geotechnical structures required for the transmission of the load from the structure to the ground (shallow and/or deep foundations) as well for the execution of excavation works (temporary or permanent retaining structures, slope stability and/or dewatering system) by means of calculation rules from Eurocode 7. The design of those geotechnical structures must be properly carried in order to agree with the requirement of the structure. If needed, the construction phases must also be studied and optimized to ensure sufficient stability of temporary structures during all the steps of construction.This part of the project requires to have basic notions in soil mechanics and geotechnical engineering, as given in the course of Soil Mechanics (Bachelor 3) and Geotechnical Engineering (Master 1) at ULB and VUB. However, other similar background could be well suited. Along the different working sessions, some additional theoretical concepts will be given to provide the necessary tools to the students to address specific aspects of the project. Those theoretical classes depend from project to project.\n",

System theory provides a general framework for the analysis and the control of dynamical systems. In this course the study of Discrete Time Linear Invariant Systems will emphasized.Module II - This module is devoted to the control of sampled data system. A sample data system is a system that is continuous-time by nature but that is controlled through digital devices (e.g. micro-controller). To do so, the basic properties of sampling and reconstruction will be recalled and their effects on dynamic system detailed. Then, we will overview some of the classical methods to control them. Classical industrial schemes and a few advanced control schemes such as Model Predictive Control will be introduced.Laboratory - During the laboratory sessions, students will be grouped in teams of 2-4 people. The group composition will be decided by the teaching assistant. Each team will be assigned as soon as possible to one pilot plant and will receive :- a document containing a description of the plant to control and of the control technology available in the laboratory- a list of specifications to reach- a document with some hints on aspects not covered in this course but that can be useful to accomplish the project (e.g. identification), on how to manage the project and a possible template for the report.Goal of the project is to make the design choices, parameter tuning, simulative and experimental tests so as to develop control schemes able to reach in the best possible way the required specifications.Course material : Lecture notes, exercises, references and slides are available in the website : http://www.gprix.it/teaching.htm\n",

      "1) Physical models of transistors - MOSFETs: modelling of weak, moderate and strong inversion, second-order effects due to downscaling of transistors (e.g. velocity saturation, short-channel effects). Hence, we go much further than the elementary quadratic model of a MOS transistor. Further, all elements of the small-signal equivalent circuit are considered. In order to make a better link to circuits, all aspects of the transistor behavior are explained in terms of voltages and electrostatic potentials, rather than energy diagrams, as is the case in many device courses (e.g. 'Electronic components 1' from the VUB). 2) Analysis of elementary transistor circuits In IR-ETRO-3504b, a simple explanation has been given for the operation of a few elementary one-transistor and two-transistor circuits. Here, the CMOS circuits are studied more in detail. Further, more attention is paid to an integrated realization of these elementary circuits (e.g. as part of a larger analog IC), rather than to a discrete realization. Further, mismatches between corresponding circuit elements in differential circuits are studied. A good insight in elementary circuits is very valuable for a good understanding of larger and/or more complicated analog (integrated) circuits such as operational amplifiers. 3) Operational Amplifiers (opamps) and operational transconductance amplifiers (OTAs) A few widely used CMOS configurations are studied, such as a two-stage OTA with Miller compensation and a balanced OTA with compensation by the load capacitance at the output. For these circuits an analysis is performed of the low-frequency small-signal behavior, frequency response, gain bandwidth product, stability, slew rate, common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR), power supply rejection ratio, noise behavior, common-mode input range, output swing, offset and influence of mismatches. 4) The practical session: Going through the complete design process of an analog integrated circuit. There is a practical session on the design of a CMOS operational amplifier as part of a bigger system (e.g. an active filter). The students make this project in groups of two persons. This comprises the design of a given fixed topology of an operational amplifier. This topology is analyzed using hand calculations. After an analysis the transistors are sized using the equations generated in the analysis phase. Next, this design is simulated and layout aspects are considered. The students have to write a design report to prove that they master the design by justifying the design choices that they made. 5) Exercises: preparing the students for the practical session on opamp design. 6) Measurement lab session: in the previous year, as part of the course “Electronics” (IR-ETRO-3504b), a small CMOS circuit has been designed and submitted for fabrication. This circuit is measured in a lab session.\n",

      "General goal of the courseEngineers and scientists build models to understand, describe, predict and control the behaviour of the environment. In order to create these models it is necessary to combine the mathematical models with (noisy) measurements. In this course we will first learn how to measure the characteristics of a dynamic system (Spectral analysis, frequency response function measurements). Next we will explain how experimental data can be turned into good mathematical models. Besides a sound theoretical basis, we will provide the students also with hand on experience in the labs. Short outline: Measuring: Introduction to Spectral measurement techniques Introduction to frequency response measurements From data to model: Why do we need identification methods?

Moreover, the course does not put the emphasis on maths but on the hands on experience: design, implementation, and critical evaluation of the advanced controllers. Therefore the course also provides practical insight that is very useful to design and implement the controllers.

      "Learning objective Analysis and design of analog electronic circuits is done using computer aided engineering (CAE) tools. The methods used comprise dc analysis, ac analysis, transient analysis, harmonic balance analysis, shooting method, large-signal / small signal analysis,… It is evident that every tool is optimized to analyze a specific type of circuit or analysis. Take for example the transient simulation which is available in SPICE. This transient simulator is not suited for analyzing nonlinear microwave circuits or for the noise analysis in mixers. To solve this problem, simulation techniques such as harmonic balance were developed. Harmonic balance assumes that all signal are either periodic of quasi-periodic. This makes harmonic balance unsuited for non-quasi-periodic signals, but makes the technique superior for the analysis of nonlinear microwave circuit and the noise analysis of mixer. The aim of the course is to teach the future engineer the pros and contras of the different available simulation tools. This way, he/she should be able to judge which CAE-tool is the most appropriate for solving his/her design or analysis problem. Besides the choice of the analysis tool, there is also the problem of setting the simulation parameters correctly. This requires some background in the actual implementation of the simulations techniques. Hence, a theoretical background of the different simulation techniques must be given in the course. In addition to the theoretical aspect, it is important to have practical experience with the simulation tools. This will lead to a future engineer which does not lose time by simulating with a sub-optimal simulation tool. Elektronica, Netwerken en filters Content I. THEORETICAL CONSIDERATIONS DC & AC ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES TRANSIENT ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES - Assumptions - Integration methods and integration step - Simulation parameters - Simulation of oscillators - Extension: transient analysis with periodic signals: the shooting method HARMONIC BALANCE - Principle of harmonic balance - Time-domain to frequency domain transformation: periodic and quasi-periodic transformations - Large-signal / small-signal analysis - Analysis of oscillators with harmonic balance - Sparse matrix technique for solving sets of equations - Extension: non-quasi-periodic analysis: the envelop simulator. II. PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF THE THEORY THROUGH THE USE OF THE CAE-TOOLS To put the theory into practice, several practical assignments are given to apply the CAE-tools to analyze given designs. The assignment requires the analysis of one circuit with several simulation method. An example is the analysis of comparing a harmonic balance based method with a transient analysis based method. Following methods for the basis of the practical assignments: - Analysis of a high-frequency oscillator - Analysis of the nonlinear distortion of an amplifier: single-tone excitation en modulated signals, nonlinear behavior (IP2, IP3) - Analysis of a mixer: isolation, nonlinear behavior (IP2, IP3) - Noise analysis of a mixer K.S.

On a systematic way the measurement chain is analysed : transducer, amplifier, filters, and measuring device (e.g. FFT-analyser). Starting from basic measuring techniques, more sophisticated analysis techniques such as spectrum and orbital analysis are discussed as well as shock pulse techniques and cepstrum analysis. The use of vibration analysis in predictive maintenance strategy is not forgotten. More and more humans are subjected to vibrations and this not only during labour time but also in his private life. Therefore the effects of vibration on human beings are studied. Finally, the advantages of advanced vibrational tests and modal analysis are illustrated. Part II - Acoustics The purpose of this course is to give the students a good theoretical basis in acoustics so that they will be able to control noise problems. First of all, the wave nature of sound waves and related parameters such as frequency, wave length and sound velocity are studied. The dB scale is then introduced and the currently used sound pressure level scales such as Leq, statistical sound levels, SEL are defined. Then a detailed study of the human ear is performed, which leads to the definition of phone and sone and the introduction of the A-filters. Also other acoustical parameters, such as sound intensity and sound power are defined. The methodology of correct noise measurements is then discussed introducing microphone, pistonphone, octave band filters and measuring devices. As noise reduction is important, the principle and use of acoustical absorption and isolation are discussed. Then the impact of noise on the environment is analysed using an emission-transmission-immission model. The noise legislation for protecting industrial workers and community is also discussed.

It will focus on the components used and their functionality, and more particularly on the communication and diagnosis systems, where data buses such as the CAN bus (controller area network) are specifically treated and illustrated in practical exercises. Future evolutions of these technolgies are highlighted. Aspects ike electrical energy storage and electric traction are not covered as such, since these are treated by specific courses. Partim VA JacobsIntroduction to radiometry and photometry,Lighting and safetyLamp technology and optical designRoad lightingSimulations in Dialux Evo 6.1Vehicle lighting Partim L. Van Biesen - H. SahliThis course aims to give students of engineering sciences a clear introduction into navigation, in the broadest sense and based on its historical development. This means that the basic knowledge of mathematical and geographical descriptions must be revised and that the theory of terrestrial navigation will be studied. Through practical examples of navigation the student is meant to become acquainted with the application of the concepts and theoretical findings. After having followed this course, students must be capable of proposing the methods required for positioning and dead reckoning, defining the uncertainties associated with it, and must be able to suggest position and movement sensors, indicate correction and processing algorithms, and will be able to analyse fusing methods and networking. When we discuss automatic navigation and intelligence emphasis is of course placed on road vehicles.Rationale: (L. Van Biesen)General introduction to automatic navigation. Short historical perspective. Introduction to geodesion and map projection systems used in navigation (Latitude and Longitude. Motivation for nautical mile and knots. Mercator and Lambert projections. Reference ellipsoids and datum, WGS84).Positioning techniques: (L. Van Biesen)Short introduction (revision) of reproduction of radio waves (general electromagnetic reproduction, antennae, reproduction modes like ground wave, ionospherical reproduction, optical view). Measuring methods divided into 4 classes (angle directing methods, phase measurements, signal strength measurements, time measurements). Removing ambiguities (with GPS serving as an example), hyperbolic positioning methods. Localising through cellular networks (GSM, UMTS).Satellite navigation: (L. Van Biesen)Study of GPS and Differential GPS. GLONASS, Galileo and GPS-III.Terrestrial navigation: (L. Van Biesen)Problems with the use of satellite positioning and cellular radio in urban areas (urban canyon navigation). Methods and sensors for estimation of positioning and dead reckoning (ABS, gyroscopes, accelerometers).Intelligent vehicles (H.

No fundamental aspects are discussed, but how the different components are combined in a real application. During the final chapter “Computing: Microcontrollers” is explained how a PIC controller functions and needs to be programmed in assembler, the basics of an Arduino microcontroller and how to control a mechatronics system.Because mechatronics require a concurrent approach, the main focus of this course will be on the realization of a mechatronics system by the student. Every year a list of new proposals will be presented. The project has to be realized in a team. The report must be provided in the form of a website that will be published on the MECH website.\n",

This includes induced currents from motion and varying magnetic fields.Also the (laminar) Navier-Stokes equations for incompressible flow and the energy conservation equation are recalled and complemented with electromagnetic terms such that fully coupled thermal-electromagnetic problems are within reach. Finally the balance equations for transport of ions in electrolytes are given. Based on the weighted residual method, and mainly applied to the Laplace equation, it is shown how the different discretisation techniques are derived and linked. We treat the finite element method (FEM), the boundary element method (BEM), the residual distribution method (RDM), the finite difference method (FDM) and a family of analytical methods. We also treat the following numerical aspects:· non-linear boundary conditions (as encountered in electrochemical problems)· non-linear media (magnetic material)· iteration methods· calculation of derived quantities such as total current and flux. The practical exercises start with the analysis of the global structure of a boundary element and finite element program. The students are next confronted with existing software in order to experience the fundamental properties of elliptic fields (boundary effects, sphere of influence, …). Finally the students are asked to solve a particular electrotechnical problem. Part 2. The modelling of electromagnetic actuators and electric machines is studied considering the following aspects: · particular 2D and 3D formulations · electrical circuit coupling, distinguishing between stranded and massive conductors · modelling of movement of rotation · force and torque calculation · magnetic material modelling · optimisation This material will be illustrated by means of a number of test cases and practical exercises for the students.\n",

Change the language to English in the dropdown menu on top of the page.Combustion science will play a major role in the future quest for sustainable, secure and environmentally friendly energy souces. Two thirds of the world energy supply relies on combustion of fossil and alternative fuels today, and all scenarios forecast an increasing absolute energy supply through combustion, with an increasing share of renewable sources. This implies that combustion will remain the major actor in transportation, power generation as well as in food,cloth, sports and entertainment industries, and in important manufacturing processes like steel and glass making.Given the role of combustion in our society, the present course aims at extending the combustion basics presented in the thermodynamic bachelor courses and extend them to cover topics in chemical kinetics, premixed and diffusion flames, laminar and turbulent reacting systems, ignition and stabilization criteria and, importantly, pollutant formation and control. The latter aspect is covered in detail, by presenting the most up-to-date technologies for the reduction of pollutants, e.g. NOx, such as flameless combustion. Finally, the heat transfer modes are analysed in the framework of combustion processes with special emphasis on radiation (the less covered aspect in the bachelor thermodynamics courses), pointing out the complexity of turbulence-radiation interactions and introducing the approaches for treating combustion in the simulation of practical combustion systems.Detailed course content:Combustion : Rehearsal on combustion thermodynamics (adiabatic flame temperature and equilibrium. Combustion kinetics (detailed and reduced mechanisms). Coupling thermal and chemical analyses of reacting systems (Reactor models). Premixed and diffusion flames (laminar and turbulent). Ignition and flame stability. Formation and control of pollutants in combustion processes. Introduction to the numerical modelling of turbulent combustion systems using state-of-the-art simulation software.Heat transfer : Conductive heat transfer in combustion systems. Convective heat transfer in combustion systems. Radiative heat transfer in combustion systems : radiative transfer and radiation/turbulence interactions, radiative properties and solution methods for numerical simulation.\n",

      "This course first gives a general overview of the design philosophy of aircraft systems, and then describes the main systems in more detail. An introductory chapter presents a historical overview of aircraft and aircraft systems, discusses certified weights and the payload-range curve, and the need for spare parts when operating aircraft. The first part of the course familiarizes students with the general concepts and philosophies of aircraft systems' design and maintenance. Systems can fail in numerous ways, with different degrees of severity, so airworthiness authorities pose specific requirements for the reliability levels of systems. This part describes safety and reliability of aircraft systems, and how maintenance can be applied to keep or restore the reliability levels. The modern approach to construct maintenance programs is discussed. The second part of the course provides students with an in-depth study of several important aircraft systems: hydraulic system, flight control system, fuel system, electrical system, landing gear, pneumatic system. The general lay-out of the systems is discussed, as are the main components and interconnections with other systems. The focus is on how these aircraft systems have been designed to meet the specific functional, operational, and safety-related requirements posed by an aircraft.\n",

      "HOC This course aims at providing an in depth knowledge of the geomorphologic processes responsible for the genesis of the morphology in fluvial and arid environments. It deals with the study of geomorphologic processes through rationalising the interrelationships between environmental conditions, rock/sediment properties, transport agents and landscape forms. Focus is put on quantifying and modeling geomorphologic processes in order to understand the behaviour of complex geomorphologic systems. The lectures serve as a basis for the applications during practical’s, lab session and for understanding specific case studies from the literature. Emphasis is put on the translation of knowledge to problem solving capacities especially related to the analysis of the impact of human actions on natural geomorphologic systems. The spatial approach is emphasized by using Google Earth, topographic maps and GIS. 1.Introduction to applied geomorphology 2.Weathering processes: a. Mechanical weathering b. Chemical weathering 3.Mass movements 4.Fluvial processes on slopes 5.Fluvial processes in river channels WPO 1.Applications of geomorphologic concepts and relationships discussed in the course to specific case studies based on the application of rock mechanics and slope stability models and the analysis of GIS data. Results of practical’s will be presented and critically discussed in oral or written reports to submit/present in the week following the practical. 2.Introduction to laboratory techniques: granulometry, density, water content, organic matter content. 3.One day field excursion (conditional). 4.The students present, in group of 2-3, the results of a personal reading project to be developed on one of the topic discussed in the course through a power point presentation and the animation of a practical activity. The project must include at least one scientific article presenting a case study based on field data and at least two complementary scientific papers related to the case study. The presentations are scheduled throughout the semester according to the lecture plan.\n",

      "Theory: This part of the course will aim at understanding the natural processes that can lead to hazards. More specifically, attention is paid to the physical processes controlling each type of hazards and the factors controlling the intensity, recurrence rate and spatial distribution hazards. Geohazards, climatic and other natural and semi-natural hazards will be examined. Geohazards, including earthquakes, landslides and volcanic eruptions, will be taken as an example to illustrate the importance of statistical analysis of extreme events, monitoring techniques, preparation of hazard maps and the implementation of mitigation measures. Students will work on a thorough hazard assessment of a region of interest on the basis of scientific literature and remote sensing data. Content 1. Extreme events statistics and their use in hazard assessment2. Flood hazard assessment in Flanders3. Cyclones and extreme climate events4. Seismic hazard assessment in Belgium5. Volcanic processes and hazards6. Remote sensing in hazard assessment WPO •Student prepare in group a hazard assessment for a selected region of interest. From topographic analysis of the DEM, reading of the relevant literature and collection of available datasets, each group evaluate the probability of occurrence of different types of hazards. They thereafter analyse the situation of preparedness to manage a crisis and propose a suitable strategy to remedy to the major weaknesses in the current situation.\n",

      "\n",
      "Theory: In the framework of global changes and increasing demographic pressure on natural resources, risk posed by natural or man-made hazards have dramatically increased over the last decades. The impact of a given hazard is never proportional to its energy but depends mostly on the vulnerability of the impacted population and the management of the crisis. Using case studies from modern crises, this course will illustrate the concepts of risks and vulnerability and the influence of global changes on the impact of hazards. The variable nature, spatial and temporal scales of hazards and vulnerability are generally described. The students will learn to differentiate the phases of a crisis, to identify the actors involved and to analyse the best practices before, during and after a crisis to avoid that a natural hazard turns into a human disaster. Guest speakers from various profesional sectors illustrate their specific approach of risk managment. Content •Introduction: risk, hazards and vulnerability; global trends •Types of hazards: nature, intensity, spatial distribution and scale, return periods •The human component of disasters: assessing vulnerbility •Risk assessment and the crisis management cycle •Disaster risk reduction strategies WPO •Group discussion around case studies based on reading assignments: each student is asked to read 1-2 pre-selected scientific papers and to give his opinion on the management of a presented crisis based on his reading.- Role plays:on the basis of a pre-established scenario, students interacts to defend the point of views of different crisis managment actors •Group work on a selected case study: the students prepare in groups a presentation on a past natural crisis. They apply theoretical concepts and analytical scheme to highight the factors that contributed to the specific disaster.\n",
