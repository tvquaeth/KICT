The theoretical part consists of 10 lectures, of which the first and the last are the most important since they discuss the course’s philosophy. The practical part consists of 6 practical sessions and a programming project. During the practical sessions, the constructs for multithreading and message-passing in java are explored. The programming project happens in groups of 2 to 3 persons. The design of simple, generic and performant parallel programs relies on deep insight in all aspects of modern hardware and software technology. The course therefore offers a wider scope than just dealing with the 'parallel issues'. 1. Overview of Parallel Systems Parallel systems constitute of processors that are connected in some way. They are more present than ever. Parallel processing is the only answer to the ever-increasing demand for more computational power. Nowadays, the big giants in hardware and software, like Intel and Microsoft, are increasingly aware of it and have pounced onto the market. This chapter presents an overview and explains why parallel resources are not for free. 2. Shared-memory paradigm: Multithreading Multiprocessors are becoming the standard in PCs. They allow for multithreaded parallel programs, which are based on the shared-memory paradigm. In this chapter all aspects are discussed that should be taken into consideration when creating multi-threaded applications. Besides an overview we will focus on the Java constructs. 3. Message-passing paradigm: MPI Processors that do not have access to each other's memory communicate by sending messages to each other. This is called the message-passing paradigm, of which MPI is the leading standard. It is discussed how MPI should be used and MPI is compared to more special parallel languages. 4. GPU computingAccelerators such as GPUs offer a tremendous amount of computational power. But such power comes at the expense of the necessary reimplementation of your code and optimization of the code towards the underlying architecture.5. Performance Analysis of Parallel Processing The main goal of parallel processing is shortening the runtime of programs. This chapter presents the performance analysis or parallel programs.6. Dense Matrix Algorithms Parallelization of matrix algorithms can happen in different ways. The, sometimes subtle, differences give us the opportunity to dig deeper in the various issues involved with parallel processing. 7. Discrete Optimization Problems More advanced issues in parallel processing can be discussed with the parallelization of discrete optimization problems. 9. Conclusions Wrap-up of the course. The discussion of the introduction are reconsidered.Finally, we list the main differences of this course with the course 'Multicore Programming' taught by Tom Van Cutsem. Parallel Systems taught by Jan Lemeire (1) Focuses on low-level approaches to parallel computing. (2) Discusses the well-established techniques for message-passing and multithreading which have proven their value. Standard thread creation and synchronization is treated in-depth, showing the threats of this technique to the student. (3) Concentrates on scientific computing, such as algorithms allowing data-parallelism (‘regular concurrency’), although all applications can be parallelized with the techniques. Focus on dedicated parallel algorithms. (4) Discusses the current trend of using GPUs for high-performance computing. Multicore Programming taught by Jennifer Sartor (1) Focuses on high-level approaches to concurrent programming. (2) Discusses cutting-edge, innovative, scientific approaches. Considers alternative approaches to multithreading, since standard multithreading is not scalable and not robust. (3) Focuses on concurrent applications with irregular concurrency, distributed systems, influence of concurrency on software architecture. Focus on parallelizing existing software. (4) Discusses important parallel software patterns such as Google’s mapreduce.\"}\n",

Hereby the influence of each error source (stochastic measurement errors, systematic measurement errors, non-linear distortions, time-variant effects, model errors...) on the final result is studied in detail.Each step is illustrated thoroughly by means of real life examples.The course starts with the basic techniques necessary to predict the stochastic behaviour of an estimator (consistency, bias, efficiency, probability density function, robustness). Furthermore, the continuous thread throughout the entire course is the formulation of the maximum likelihood solution starting from the measured data. This approach has the advantage that provides the estimated model with an estimate of its uncertainty.Contents Preliminary Example Nonparametric Models of LTI Systems Parametric Models of LTI Systems Improved Nonparametric Models for LTI Systems Estimation Parametric Plant Model with Known Noise Model Estimation Parametric Plant Model with Estimated Nonparametric Noise Model Estimation Parametric Plant and/or Noise Models Guidelines Take Home Messages Books on system identificationAimsAfter following this course, the student should be able to solve independently an identification problem.

Design an excitation signal for measuring simultaneously in a given frequency band the dynamic behaviour of a system, the noise level, the level of the nonlinear distortions, and time variant effects. Select and validate a model (discrete- or continuous-time, dynamic order) from noisy input, noisy output observations. Select an appropriate estimator for a particular identification problem. Analyse and interpret critically measurement and identification results. Make a motivated choice between non-parametric and parametric noise models.In addition, the student must have acquired insight into: The importance and use of the following asymptotic properties of an estimator: consistency, asymptotic bias, asymptotic efficiency, robustness, and asymptotic normality.

The methods used comprise dc analysis, ac analysis, transient analysis, harmonic balance analysis, shooting method, large-signal / small signal analysis,… It is evident that every tool is optimized to analyze a specific type of circuit or analysis. Take for example the transient simulation which is available in SPICE. This transient simulator is not suited for analyzing nonlinear microwave circuits or for the noise analysis in mixers. To solve this problem, simulation techniques such as harmonic balance were developed. Harmonic balance assumes that all signal are either periodic of quasi-periodic. This makes harmonic balance unsuited for non-quasi-periodic signals, but makes the technique superior for the analysis of nonlinear microwave circuit and the noise analysis of mixer. The aim of the course is to teach the future engineer the pros and contras of the different available simulation tools. This way, he/she should be able to judge which CAE-tool is the most appropriate for solving his/her design or analysis problem. Besides the choice of the analysis tool, there is also the problem of setting the simulation parameters correctly. This requires some background in the actual implementation of the simulations techniques. Hence, a theoretical background of the different simulation techniques must be given in the course. In addition to the theoretical aspect, it is important to have practical experience with the simulation tools. This will lead to a future engineer which does not lose time by simulating with a sub-optimal simulation tool. Elektronica, Netwerken en filters Content I. THEORETICAL CONSIDERATIONS DC & AC ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES TRANSIENT ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES - Assumptions - Integration methods and integration step - Simulation parameters - Simulation of oscillators - Extension: transient analysis with periodic signals: the shooting method HARMONIC BALANCE - Principle of harmonic balance - Time-domain to frequency domain transformation: periodic and quasi-periodic transformations - Large-signal / small-signal analysis - Analysis of oscillators with harmonic balance - Sparse matrix technique for solving sets of equations - Extension: non-quasi-periodic analysis: the envelop simulator. II. PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF THE THEORY THROUGH THE USE OF THE CAE-TOOLS To put the theory into practice, several practical assignments are given to apply the CAE-tools to analyze given designs. The assignment requires the analysis of one circuit with several simulation method. An example is the analysis of comparing a harmonic balance based method with a transient analysis based method. Following methods for the basis of the practical assignments: - Analysis of a high-frequency oscillator - Analysis of the nonlinear distortion of an amplifier: single-tone excitation en modulated signals, nonlinear behavior (IP2, IP3) - Analysis of a mixer: isolation, nonlinear behavior (IP2, IP3) - Noise analysis of a mixer K.S.

The core topics in this course are as follows: Advanced Content Management Systems: Advanced web-sites with complex and dynamic content are better developed and managed using a Content Management System such as Drupal. The course investigates the use and functionality of such systems. Model-based Web-Development: Web-sites that offer do not only offer content but also functionality are complex to program and can therefore benefit from a model-based approach where much of the code is generated from models that describe the desired functionality. The course discusses the standards for this and tools to support this approach. Responsive Web Design: Developing Web Applications that are responsive, i.e., adapt their layout to the device they are accessed from in order to improve the user interaction with a particular application. Search Engine Optimization: When developing web-sites and web-applications that need to attract attention, it is important to ensure that they are readily found by search engines. The course looks at techniques to maximize the probability that a site appears high in the result of important search engines. Crowdsourcing: The Web makes it possible to delegate certain tasks that are not easily solved by algorithms to so-called crowds, which can be users of an information system, visitors of a web site or other users of the Web who are somehow convinced to participate. This can in many case make tasks feasible that are not solvable by computers alone. The course looks at existing techniques to involve users in computational tasks and ways of involving them and making sure that the results they produce are trustworthy.

Opportunities and challenges concerning intellectual property and its application in a high-technology sector like biotechnology will be discussed. During the course, we invite a number of relevant guest lecturers from the biotechnology industry. Presence to guest lectures is mandatory.It is recommended to take a course in \"biotechnology\" (e.g. course by Prof. Muyldermans) before participating to this course.'}\n",

The full theory is then treated using time dependent perturbation theory - translated in the form of Feynman diagrams and rules.Subsequently we use this to analyze several standard processes in QED: pair production, scattering in an external field, Compton scattering, ...Next radiative corrections are studied thereby introducing the concepts of regularization and renormalization.

For many such problems, heuristic search techniques have been established as the most successful methods. In this course I will introduce and discuss heuristic optimization techniques with a main focus on stochastic local search techniques, which are the most relevant heuristic techniques. The course will illustrate the application principles of these algorithms using a number of example applications ranging from rather simple problems of more academic interest to more complex problems from real applications. A significant focus in the course will be also on relevant techniques for the empirical evaluation of heuristic optimization algorithms and the issues that arise in their development. Hands-on experience with these algorithmic techniques will be gained in accompanying practical exercises.'}\n",

Hence, we go much further than the elementary quadratic model of a MOS transistor. Further, all elements of the small-signal equivalent circuit are considered. In order to make a better link to circuits, all aspects of the transistor behavior are explained in terms of voltages and electrostatic potentials, rather than energy diagrams, as is the case in many device courses (e.g. 'Electronic components 1' from the VUB). 2) Analysis of elementary transistor circuits In IR-ETRO-3504b, a simple explanation has been given for the operation of a few elementary one-transistor and two-transistor circuits. Here, the CMOS circuits are studied more in detail. Further, more attention is paid to an integrated realization of these elementary circuits (e.g. as part of a larger analog IC), rather than to a discrete realization. Further, mismatches between corresponding circuit elements in differential circuits are studied. A good insight in elementary circuits is very valuable for a good understanding of larger and/or more complicated analog (integrated) circuits such as operational amplifiers. 3) Operational Amplifiers (opamps) and operational transconductance amplifiers (OTAs) A few widely used CMOS configurations are studied, such as a two-stage OTA with Miller compensation and a balanced OTA with compensation by the load capacitance at the output. For these circuits an analysis is performed of the low-frequency small-signal behavior, frequency response, gain bandwidth product, stability, slew rate, common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR), power supply rejection ratio, noise behavior, common-mode input range, output swing, offset and influence of mismatches. 4) The practical session: Going through the complete design process of an analog integrated circuit. There is a practical session on the design of a CMOS operational amplifier as part of a bigger system (e.g. an active filter). The students make this project in groups of two persons. This comprises the design of a given fixed topology of an operational amplifier. This topology is analyzed using hand calculations. After an analysis the transistors are sized using the equations generated in the analysis phase. Next, this design is simulated and layout aspects are considered. The students have to write a design report to prove that they master the design by justifying the design choices that they made. 5) Exercises: preparing the students for the practical session on opamp design. 6) Measurement lab session: in the previous year, as part of the course “Electronics” (IR-ETRO-3504b), a small CMOS circuit has been designed and submitted for fabrication. This circuit is measured in a lab session.\"}\n",

The first chapter deals about “Electronics: sensors and signal conditioning”, followed by the chapter “Mechanics: mechanisms and actuation”. No fundamental aspects are discussed, but how the different components are combined in a real application. During the final chapter “Computing: Microcontrollers” is explained how a PIC controller functions and needs to be programmed in assembler, the basics of an Arduino microcontroller and how to control a mechatronics system.Because mechatronics require a concurrent approach, the main focus of this course will be on the realization of a mechatronics system by the student.

This includes induced currents from motion and varying magnetic fields.Also the (laminar) Navier-Stokes equations for incompressible flow and the energy conservation equation are recalled and complemented with electromagnetic terms such that fully coupled thermal-electromagnetic problems are within reach. Finally the balance equations for transport of ions in electrolytes are given. Based on the weighted residual method, and mainly applied to the Laplace equation, it is shown how the different discretisation techniques are derived and linked. We treat the finite element method (FEM), the boundary element method (BEM), the residual distribution method (RDM), the finite difference method (FDM) and a family of analytical methods. We also treat the following numerical aspects:· non-linear boundary conditions (as encountered in electrochemical problems)· non-linear media (magnetic material)· iteration methods· calculation of derived quantities such as total current and flux. The practical exercises start with the analysis of the global structure of a boundary element and finite element program. The students are next confronted with existing software in order to experience the fundamental properties of elliptic fields (boundary effects, sphere of influence, …). Finally the students are asked to solve a particular electrotechnical problem. Part 2. The modelling of electromagnetic actuators and electric machines is studied considering the following aspects: · particular 2D and 3D formulations · electrical circuit coupling, distinguishing between stranded and massive conductors · modelling of movement of rotation · force and torque calculation · magnetic material modelling · optimisation This material will be illustrated by means of a number of test cases and practical exercises for the students.'}\n",

System theory provides a general framework for the analysis and the control of dynamical systems. In this course the study of Discrete Time Linear Invariant Systems will emphasized.Module II - This module is devoted to the control of sampled data system. A sample data system is a system that is continuous-time by nature but that is controlled through digital devices (e.g. micro-controller). To do so, the basic properties of sampling and reconstruction will be recalled and their effects on dynamic system detailed. Then, we will overview some of the classical methods to control them. Classical industrial schemes and a few advanced control schemes such as Model Predictive Control will be introduced.Laboratory - During the laboratory sessions, students will be grouped in teams of 2-4 people. The group composition will be decided by the teaching assistant. Each team will be assigned as soon as possible to one pilot plant and will receive :- a document containing a description of the plant to control and of the control technology available in the laboratory- a list of specifications to reach- a document with some hints on aspects not covered in this course but that can be useful to accomplish the project (e.g. identification), on how to manage the project and a possible template for the report.Goal of the project is to make the design choices, parameter tuning, simulative and experimental tests so as to develop control schemes able to reach in the best possible way the required specifications.Course material : Lecture notes, exercises, references and slides are available in the website : http://www.gprix.it/teaching.htm'}\n",

On a systematic way the measurement chain is analysed : transducer, amplifier, filters, and measuring device (e.g. FFT-analyser). Starting from basic measuring techniques, more sophisticated analysis techniques such as spectrum and orbital analysis are discussed as well as shock pulse techniques and cepstrum analysis. The use of vibration analysis in predictive maintenance strategy is not forgotten. More and more humans are subjected to vibrations and this not only during labour time but also in his private life. Therefore the effects of vibration on human beings are studied. Finally, the advantages of advanced vibrational tests and modal analysis are illustrated. Part II - Acoustics The purpose of this course is to give the students a good theoretical basis in acoustics so that they will be able to control noise problems. First of all, the wave nature of sound waves and related parameters such as frequency, wave length and sound velocity are studied. The dB scale is then introduced and the currently used sound pressure level scales such as Leq, statistical sound levels, SEL are defined. Then a detailed study of the human ear is performed, which leads to the definition of phone and sone and the introduction of the A-filters. Also other acoustical parameters, such as sound intensity and sound power are defined. The methodology of correct noise measurements is then discussed introducing microphone, pistonphone, octave band filters and measuring devices. As noise reduction is important, the principle and use of acoustical absorption and isolation are discussed. Then the impact of noise on the environment is analysed using an emission-transmission-immission model. The noise legislation for protecting industrial workers and community is also discussed. Finally room acoustics are studied in details.The valid fiche for ULB can be found at the following link : MECA-H411. Change the language to English in the dropdown menu on top of the page.'}\n",

The first part of the course familiarizes students with the general concepts and philosophies of aircraft systems' design and maintenance. Systems can fail in numerous ways, with different degrees of severity, so airworthiness authorities pose specific requirements for the reliability levels of systems. This part describes safety and reliability of aircraft systems, and how maintenance can be applied to keep or restore the reliability levels. The modern approach to construct maintenance programs is discussed. The second part of the course provides students with an in-depth study of several important aircraft systems: hydraulic system, flight control system, fuel system, electrical system, landing gear, pneumatic system. The general lay-out of the systems is discussed, as are the main components and interconnections with other systems.

This means that the basic knowledge of mathematical and geographical descriptions must be revised and that the theory of terrestrial navigation will be studied. Through practical examples of navigation the student is meant to become acquainted with the application of the concepts and theoretical findings. After having followed this course, students must be capable of proposing the methods required for positioning and dead reckoning, defining the uncertainties associated with it, and must be able to suggest position and movement sensors, indicate correction and processing algorithms, and will be able to analyse fusing methods and networking. When we discuss automatic navigation and intelligence emphasis is of course placed on road vehicles.Rationale: (L. Van Biesen)General introduction to automatic navigation. Short historical perspective. Introduction to geodesion and map projection systems used in navigation (Latitude and Longitude. Motivation for nautical mile and knots. Mercator and Lambert projections. Reference ellipsoids and datum, WGS84).Positioning techniques: (L.

Part 2 : Structural Engineering and Geotechnical Project (0-0-9 ECTS)Part 2.1 : Structural Engineering Coordination: L. PylThe assignment is to analyze, in a team, a mid-rise concrete building. This structural analysis process consists of the following steps:- Preliminary design: choice of the lay-out of the structural elements (direction of the spans, the beams and distance between columns; pre-design of slabs, beams and columns; visualization of the structure by plans (plan view, sections, wireframe views) and eventually a structural 3D mock up.- Structural analysis:Determination of loads and combinations using EC1, making calculation hypothesis and a static modelStructural analysis using analytical methodsIf necessary, verification of the dynamic behaviour of the structure- Dimensioning of the structure according to the Eurocodes, including the slabs, the beams, the columns and the central core- Detailing of some important structural parts, including the reinforcement calculations- Written and oral reportingIn order to support the structural design process, several theoretical classes are given, that can depend from project to project (a.o. introduction to structural design, calculation of wind loads and horizontal stability of structures, ...). Part 2.2 : Geotechnical EngineeringCoordination: P. GérardThe objective of the geotechnical part of the project is to design the geotechnical structures required for the transmission of the load from the structure to the ground (shallow and/or deep foundations) as well for the execution of excavation works (temporary or permanent retaining structures, slope stability and/or dewatering system) by means of calculation rules from Eurocode 7. The design of those geotechnical structures must be properly carried in order to agree with the requirement of the structure. If needed, the construction phases must also be studied and optimized to ensure sufficient stability of temporary structures during all the steps of construction.This part of the project requires to have basic notions in soil mechanics and geotechnical engineering, as given in the course of Soil Mechanics (Bachelor 3) and Geotechnical Engineering (Master 1) at ULB and VUB. However, other similar background could be well suited. Along the different working sessions, some additional theoretical concepts will be given to provide the necessary tools to the students to address specific aspects of the project.

Sustainable design requires a holistic view, which takes all aspects into account that are of influence on the complete life cycle of constructions, their constitutive components and the materials they are made of, not neglecting the urban scale on which they operate. Taking responsibility for one’s designs and the way they behave in and interact with the built environment - now and in the future - is a key aspect.‘Entities’ (urban fragments, constructions, components) which are required to be of use here and now, but also in a future (unknown) scenario, have to be provided with an adaptive or transformational capacity. Transformation of structures for architectural and structural engineering applications is generally accomplished by one of two means: by incorporating a kinematic mechanism into the structure or by conceiving the construction as a kit-of-parts system.Designing a structural mechanism leads to what is commonly known as a ‘deployable structure’, allowing an instant transformation from a compact state to an expanded, deployed configuration, in which it is ready for use. Examples are exhibition pavilions, emergency tents, stage covers for festivals, or even large retractable roofs for sports stadia.Designing a kit of parts system requires that the structure can be partly or completely dismantled into its components, after which it can be rebuilt, allowing the structure to adapt to changing circumstances. Key concepts are compatibility and re-use of components. This course focusses on gaining knowledge and insight in some aspects of sustainable design and transformable structures: the necessary concepts, methodologies, tools and techniques are taught. Digital parametric design tools (Rhinoceros 3D + plugin Grasshopper) are taught and by means of intermediate exercises it is shown how these can be used for the design and the evaluation of a transformable concept. As a final assignment the student is expected to be able to apply this knowledge by himself in a design project, thereby demonstrating insight, creativity and critical reflection. The developed concept operates on one or several of four levels: material, component, structure or urban scale.'}\n",

Part 1 Fundamentals of the design of structures in reinforced concrete This part starts with a short overview of design methods: elastic design, method using partial safety factors, probabilistic design and failure design. Next, the design loads are identified. This includes fundamental aspects on the identification of structural schemes and the performance of structural analysis of structures in reinforced concrete. Finally, material behavior is discussed, with the identification of the design values. Part 2 Basic theory of design of beams in reinforced concrete This part first focuses on the determination of the main reinforcement in reinforced concrete sections in the Ultimate Limit State (ULS), and on the verification of sections in the Serviceability Limit State (SLS): verification of stress levels and simplified criteria for avoiding unacceptable crack opening and deformation. Practical detailing of reinforcement is also discussed. Next, attention is paid to the design for shear, with analysis of shear strength of members without and with shear reinforcement and to the detailing of shear reinforcement. Finally, fundamentals about crack opening are presented in view of the introduction of the simplified model for deflection calculation. Part 3 Design of slabs This part is limited to the design of one-way, two-way and continuous slabs by means of simplified design methods (Marcus, Czerny). Attention is paid to the practical detailing of reinforcement and the torsion problem in corners. The equivalent framework method for flat slab design is discussed and is complemented by an introduction to the punching shear design problem. Finally, the strip method is presented as a versatile tool for solving various design problems: openings in slabs, concentrated loads, complex shapes and boundary conditions. Part 4 Design of columns This part is limited to the determination of the sensitivity of columns for buckling and to the detailing of reinforcement in columns. Buckling analysis is not part of this course. Part 5 Strut and tie method This part presents the strut and tie method for the design of walls, foundation blocs, deep beams, corbels and all regions with discontinuity in geometry or actions.'}\n",

First it tries to give an overview of the different physical mechanisms through which the optical sensor changes the characteristics of a light signal by allowing it to interact with a physical measurand. We therefore review the most important characteristics of an optical signal, the principles of interferometry, the Bragg condition and the elastooptic effect. Second, it describes how optical sensors are built, what their main specifications are and which aspects one has to consider for building an effective sensor. Both free space optical sensors and optical fiber sensors are investigated: Free space sensors are applied to the measurement of distance and displacement; speed and acceleration; and temperature. Optical fiber point sensors based on interferometry, Bragg gratings or distributed sensors are compared and the potential of multiplexing is studied.'}\n",

The first one is relevant to urban planning architecture and aims at developing a “master plan” of the site (first semester, DESIGN STUDIO SUSTAINABLE DESIGN a”). A second one is relevant to architecture and involves, on one hand, the in depth study of a building within the Master Plan, “targeted project “, and on the other hand its technical aspects and choice of materials, the “detailed project” (second semester, DESIGN STUDIO SUSTAINABLE DESIGN b)Global objectives of the studio: to create a sustainable architectural and urban complex organism, which entails: Learn the questioning and taking attitude in regards to the elements at stake of a program and a site within the general context of Sustainable Development. Learn to apprehend the composition of such complex organism integrating various (apparently disparate) functions from which one ought to create a coherent spatial organization in relation with its more general urban context. Learn how to manage left-over spaces generated by the site’s numerous structures. Learn how to question the potential of existing structures in regards to their capacity in supporting or developing a more comprehensive urban regeneration and the urban densification in response to the territorial factors within the sustainable vision at every scale (city, district and building scales down to materials and systems.) Learn how to implement various aspects of environmentally friendly approaches to urban design and architecture according to different trends and visions (bioclimatic, sustainability, C2C…).

Through guest lectures, discussion, writing and reading, the course introduces students to research in these disciplines. Ex-cathedra lectures offer both in-depth thematic analyses and general insights in relevant historical facts and actors in the fields of post-war construction and architecture, their complex relations, impact and interrelated historiographies. The fields are confronted through a focus on the broad and decisive changes instigated by the introduction of new technologies and methods in building in the period 1940-1980. A selection of these new post-war technological 'tools' will be treated in detail, confronting students with the interweaving of fields of knowledge: prefabrication, plastics, lightweight building (tensegrity, 3D frames, tensile structures), modern wood, new requirements in comfort, etc. Students unfamiliar with the history of pre-war western modernism in architecture are required to read additional (selected) texts at the start of the course.\"}\n",

The initial lectures present an overview of existing quality assurance techniques and their foundations:1. Detecting and managing software clones2. Detecting mechanical bugs using static analysis3. Run-time monitoring of assertions and invariants4. Assessing test suites using mutation analysis5. Generating tests using symbolic execution6. Debugging using program slicing In the final lectures, we study recent publications to understand how these techniques are evolving to cope with the complexity of contemporary software. For these lectures, students prepare a presentation themselves on which they will be graded. The goal of the practical sessions is to gain experience in applying, evaluating and possibly extending these techniques effectively to a real piece of software.

Change the language to English in the dropdown menu on top of the page.Combustion science will play a major role in the future quest for sustainable, secure and environmentally friendly energy souces. Two thirds of the world energy supply relies on combustion of fossil and alternative fuels today, and all scenarios forecast an increasing absolute energy supply through combustion, with an increasing share of renewable sources. This implies that combustion will remain the major actor in transportation, power generation as well as in food,cloth, sports and entertainment industries, and in important manufacturing processes like steel and glass making.Given the role of combustion in our society, the present course aims at extending the combustion basics presented in the thermodynamic bachelor courses and extend them to cover topics in chemical kinetics, premixed and diffusion flames, laminar and turbulent reacting systems, ignition and stabilization criteria and, importantly, pollutant formation and control. The latter aspect is covered in detail, by presenting the most up-to-date technologies for the reduction of pollutants, e.g. NOx, such as flameless combustion. Finally, the heat transfer modes are analysed in the framework of combustion processes with special emphasis on radiation (the less covered aspect in the bachelor thermodynamics courses), pointing out the complexity of turbulence-radiation interactions and introducing the approaches for treating combustion in the simulation of practical combustion systems.Detailed course content:Combustion : Rehearsal on combustion thermodynamics (adiabatic flame temperature and equilibrium. Combustion kinetics (detailed and reduced mechanisms). Coupling thermal and chemical analyses of reacting systems (Reactor models). Premixed and diffusion flames (laminar and turbulent). Ignition and flame stability. Formation and control of pollutants in combustion processes. Introduction to the numerical modelling of turbulent combustion systems using state-of-the-art simulation software.Heat transfer : Conductive heat transfer in combustion systems. Convective heat transfer in combustion systems. Radiative heat transfer in combustion systems : radiative transfer and radiation/turbulence interactions, radiative properties and solution methods for numerical simulation.'}\n",

The real value of the Web can only be unlocked if the huge amount of available data can be found, analysed, and exploited so that each user can quickly find information that is both relevant and comprehensive for their needs.Information Retrieval (IR) is the discipline that deals with the representation, storage, organisation of, and access to information items, and it is concerned with providing efficient access to large amounts of unstructured contents, such as text, images, videos etc. The objective of the IN4325 - Information Retrieval course is to introduce the scientific underpinnings of the field of Information Retrieval. The course aims at providing students basic information retrieval concepts and more advanced techniques for efficient data processing, storage, and querying. Students are also provided with a rich and comprehensive catalogue of information search tools that can be exploited in the design and implementation of Web and Enterprise search engines.The following topics are covered: Basic IR Models (boolean, vector-based, probabilistic); Basic Indexing Techniques; Term Weighting and Scoring; Web Search; Relevance Feedback and Query Expansion; Semantic Search Information Seeking Paradigms Evaluation of information retrieval systems'}\n",

Machines have gotten faster and faster, smaller and smaller. We have much larger and more complex pieces of software now than we did 40 years ago. This course will be about de-mystifying how to evaluate and analyze the performance of computer programs, particularly those written in managed languages. We will look at the software stack, and discuss how each of the layers -- the application, the compiler, the (potential) runtime environment, the operating system, the processor, and the memory system -- all impact the end performance of a program. We will look at some tools that shed light on why a program gets the execution time it does - analyzing its memory behavior or in what methods the bottlenecks might be. These are profiling or performance monitoring tools that are relatively easy to use to analyze performance. We will talk about metrics and statistics - once you run a program or a suite of programs, how do you accurately present and summarize results about their performance? Finally, we will touch on how the multicore era has also influenced the industry, and talk about the opportunities and limitations programming in parallel bring to performance. We will include a discussion on heterogeneous hardware, as well, and how some computer architects have modeled these machines to help design future processors. The following list of topics will be discussed: The software stack Superscalar and out-of-order processors, at a high level The memory subsystem and how memory is laid out, caches Performance tools such as perf to obtain hardware performance counters Details of managed language runtime environments (like the Java virtual machine) and how they impact performance Garbage collection algorithms Dynamic compilation and profiling Statistics and how to present results - which means to use and how to do confidence intervals. Parallelism: Amdahl's Law, Gustafson's Law, speedup and scalability Analytical model of processors, superscalar pipeline, simulators Multicores: chip multiprocessors (CMPs) and heterogeneous machinesOf the layers of the software/system stack, we will focus more on the runtime environment and memory system than other layers. We will touch on details about adaptive or dynamic compilers that are used in managed runtime environments. We will also discuss processors and how they execute instructions. Understanding how they work at a high level helps to understand how an application achieves the performance it does. Also, the memory system is clearly linked to the processor and has a huge impact on overall performance. So we will focus on how caches are laid out and used, and how a runtime environment lays out memory and reclaims dead memory. To gather information about the hardware's behavior, we will explore hardware performance counters, and use tools that can read them and summarize results from them.Two important aspects of analyzing performance are 1) how to properly set up experiments to measure and evaluate what you want to show, and 2) how to present results if you do perform experiments. We will discuss proper experimental methodology (for Java applications), such as how to eliminate non-determinism and exploring the space-time tradeoff of garbage collection. I will also teach good practices on how to repeat experiments and take averages over a set of results, and present confidence intervals in graphs.Finally, we will explore a bit of how parallel programming affects performance. We'll assume a shared-memory model. We will discuss speedup and Amdahl's Law and Gustafson's law. We'll talk a little about cache coherence and false sharing. We'll talk a bit about the OS's job scheduling tasks. We will also talk briefly about the hardware reordering instructions and memory consistency, if time allows. We will also touch on power as a prime concern, which led to the rise of heterogeneous machines.\"}\n",

This report estimates that the number of healthy life years lost because of neurological disorders will increase from 92 million in 2005 to 103 million in 2030, approximately a 12% increase mainly due to the aging population. Hence, there is still an important interest in neuroscience research to study the brain under normal and pathological conditions, even though, therapeutic successes have been few. Especially translational aims have been a remarkable engine for driving research investment in the neurosciences. Translational neuroscience is defined as:1. Experimental non-human and non-clinical (basic science) studies conducted with the specific intent to discover mechanisms, biomarkers, pathogenesis or treatments of nervous system disorders; and2. Clinical studies that provide a foundation for developing, or that directly test, novel therapeutic strategies for humans with nervous system disorders.In other words, translational neuroscience will bring basic preclinical knowledge (from the bench) to clinical practice (to the bedside) to expand understanding of brain structure, function and disease, and translate this knowledge into clinical applications and novel therapies of nervous system disorders. Thus, translational neuroscience is the process of using all technological advances to bring novel therapies with measurable outcomes to patients with neurological diseases. In this course, emphasis will be on translational neuroimaging, where multiple imaging techniques are used to bridge the gap between preclinical research and clinic practice. These imaging methods need to fulfil certain criteria such as being non-invasive (MRI), or at least minimal invasive (PET), and providing quantitative information to simplify the process of translating preclinical findings into the clinic.Contents· The importance of small animal imaging· Multimodal neuroimaging· Setting up a small animal experiment· Animal models· Opto-genetics· Chemo-genetics· Computing for the characterization of neurodegenerative disorders· Examples of translational neuroscience experiments at our university'}\n",

Practical: Calculation of the probability of particle processes in the Weinberg-Salam model and quantum chromodynamics. Modern introduction to relativistic quantum field theory and elementary particle physics based on the path integral formalism. Emphasis is on understanding the physical concepts and their relationship with the mathematical model.', 'content': 'Elementary particles are the quanta of their underlying particle field. Consequently, relativistic quantum field theory forms the basis of elementary particle physics. The particle character of a quantum field appears elegantly in the path integral formalism. A perturbative development of the path integral gives rise to a diagrammatic representation of the different particle processes using Feynman diagrams. Elementary particles also have internal symmetries, and for Yang Millship theories with local gauge symmetry, special precautions are required to correctly define the path integral. This gives rise to the introduction of the so-called Faddeev-Popovspook particles that have no physical meaning but serve to keep the theory mathematically consistent (preservation of probability). Another technical issue is the problem of renormalisation: quantum fluctuations on an infinitely small distance scale cause divergences. A modern view of these divergences is provided by the derormalization group. Applications of Yang-Millskwantum field theory are the Weinberg-Salam model for electroweak interactions and quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the theory of quarks and gluons that describes the strong interactions. As an example of an application of the renormalization group, the asymptotic freedom of quarks is discussed in detail. Certain aspects of the quark conflict problem and the non-relativistic quark model are also discussed. We end with a vision of the future: GUT (Grand Unified Theory) and string theory.'}\n",

In this part we review the development of the Stochastic Discount Factor. In particular, we start from the standard deterministic discounting technique and show how general equilibrium Euler equations allow us to extend the main idea of deterministic discounting to stochastic discounting. This stochastic discounting technique allows in principle to price all assets. Standard financial concepts such as the risk-free rate, the mean-variance frontier, the Sharpe ratio and others are introduced and interpreted within this basic SDF framework. Arbitrage Pricing Theories . In this part of the course we show that the SDF model does not depend on the exact equilibrium pricing model. Instead, SDF representations follow from imposing the absence of arbitrage opportunities. We introduce a formal definition of arbitrage opportunities and show that the absence of arbitrage implies the existence of a linear pricing function (the SDF). Within this theory we discuss the concepts of (in)complete markets, contingent claims and Arrow Debreu prices. While the development of the no-arbitrage theory is rather abstract we also provide the more practical market models that are implied by the no-arbitrage approach. In particular, we show how the standard CAPM model, the APT model and the Fama-French factor representation all follow as special cases of the Arbitrage Pricing Theories. Finally, we discuss the analysis of dynamic trading startegies Macro-Finance theories . In this part of the course we return to the equilibrium interpretation of the SDF and try to identify it in terms of macroeconomic quantities. This macroeconomic interpretation is not pursued in relative pricing models such as CAPM, APT or Fama-French and requires additional structure. In particular, we focus on risk attitudes (Arrow-Pratt) measures of risk and intertemporal rate of substitution as implied by specific types of utility functions. A practical implication of the above framework is represented by a set of Macro-Finance theories, explaining financial prices based on macroeconomic developments. We will discuss some benchmark models as well as the well-known asset pricing puzzles. Empirical analysis . Most of the analysis in the previous parts is theoretical in nature. In the last part of this course we focus on the practical and the empirical implications of the SDF theory. In particular, we focus on the main implication of SDF: under risk aversion some predictability should be present in financial markets (in the form of risk premia). We analyze bond, stock and exchange rate markets and identify the type of predictability implied by the data. Several time series models will be used in this part. /', 'situating': \"The course provides an in-depth analysis of price formation on financial markets. Within this framework, a pivotal role is played by the 'Fundamental Theorem of Finance' which implies the existence of a Stochastic Discount Factor (SDF) in a no-arbitrage environment. This SDF can be used to generate standard equilibrium pricing theories for, among others, stocks, bonds and exchange rates. The main goals of this course are to (i) introduce the SDF approach to finance (ii) develop equilibrium pricing models for the different financial markets (stock, bonds and exchange rates) (iii) provide macro-finance theories of the stock and bond markets and (iv) discuss the empirical implications and evidence of these price theories. Upon completion of this course, the student is able to: understand the main financial theories (CAPM, Fama-French, Risk Neutral Pricing, Arrow-Debreu pricing) and in particular the role of systemic versus idiosyncratic risk factors in asset pricing use the above mentioned theories in assessing the impact of different types of fundamental (macro) factors (shocks) on financial markets apply the pricing methods in the analysis of specific and practical pricing problems of bonds, stocks and especially standard derivative products\", 'semester': '1', 'lecturer': 'Dewachter Hans', 'credits': '6', 'study_time': '180.0', 'contact_hours': '39 ', 'language': 'EN'}\n",

Planning and scheduling are decision-making processes that occur in many manufacturing and service industries. In this course we study planning and scheduling processes mainly from a project viewpoint, but the principles and methodologies of this project scheduling are also applicable in a production environment. The course consists of two parts. Part I (Project scheduling) deals with project systems, which involve activities to be performed in a production or service environment, by following given precedence relationships with or without additional resource constraints. The planning phase of a project involves a listing of tasks or jobs that must be performed to bring about the project’s completion. Gross requirements for material, equipment, and manpower are also determined in this phase, and estimates of durations and costs for the various jobs are made. We will study the use of activity-on-the-arc and activity-on-the-node networks to represent the projects to be planned. Scheduling is the laying out of the actual jobs of the project in the time order in which they have to be performed. Manpower and material requirements needed at each stage of production are calculated along with the expected completion time of each of the jobs. Control begins with reviewing the difference between the schedule and actual performance once the project has begun. The analysis and correction of this difference forms the basic aspects of control. The main topics discussed in Part I can be listed as follows: project representation using activity networks, time analysis (estimating the project duration in a deterministic and probabilistic setting), resource management, i.e. resource leveling (leveling the use of the resources over time subject to a project deadline) and resource-constrained-project scheduling (scheduling the activities subject to the various precedence and resource constraints in order to minimize the project duration), cash flow management (scheduling a project in order to maximize its net present value), time/cost trade-off problems (taking corrective actions in order to bring a project back to plan), project scheduling under risk and proactive/reactive project scheduling (protecting the baseline schedule to anticipate possible schedule disruptions that may occur during project execution, and the deployment of reactive procedures to repair the schedule when it breaks despite the built-in protection). Part II (Project management) deals with the generally recognized good practices of project management.

Heat can be transferred in different ways, which means that knowledge from different scientific domains must be combined. A thorough introduction to hydro- and aerodynamics is necessary to properly understand heat transfer through convection. Heat transfer through conduction is closely related to disciplines such as field theory and electromagnetism. Heat transfer by radiation is based on concepts from (quantum) physics. In the derivation of theory, and in solving practical problems, there is a strong emphasis on analogies with and techniques from different disciplines. In addition to a general description of the different forms of heat transfer, specific attention is given to phenomena that occur in the micro and nanoelectronics, such as heat transfer in sine regimes.

Despite this observation and the lack of theoretical foundations and models, it is important that graduating engineers master the core technology and relevant concepts, and recognize their potential. Blockchain technology is related to cryptography (cryptographic primitives form the core of blockchain security), to distributed systems (as a form of distributed registers whose content is controlled in a distributed manner), and to computer security (since it often involves building trust between each other not trusting partners).

The course first discusses the study of the flow of groundwater in saturated soil as well as the available models and calculation techniques for the solution of the basic equations that are drawn up for this. The study of mass transport encompasses the expansion of the above-mentioned basic equations, because in addition to water, contaminants can also move in the groundwater, which is expressed by other comparisons. Subsequently, the flow of groundwater and contaminant transport is treated in unsaturated soil. For this study additional flow characteristics are determined and appropriate constitutive behavioral laws are drawn up. Multi-phase flow occurs when, in addition to and simultaneously with water, another fluid, which is not dissolved in water, moves into the ground. This concerns a 2-phase (saturated flow) or 3-phase (unsaturated ground) flow. Darcy&#39;s law and the basic equations that allow the transport of groundwater to be described can be applied in situations where the level of the groundwater or the hydraulic head has to be changed.

It is a multi-disciplinary approach that combines physical and chemical insights to understand what is happening at the nanoscale or at the level of individual chemical reactions. Due to the enormous increase in computational capacities and advanced physical and numerical models, this approach is indispensable from current chemical technology. It can be argued that molecular modeling is now able to supply instruments that can be used for computer-assisted evaluation, innovation and optimization of chemical processes and catalysts starting from the molecular scale. Due to the complexity of industrial processes and the many reactions that can go on simultaneously, it is often impossible to gain insight into individual reactions. Catalysts and processes have often been developed in the past on the basis of try-and-error. The insight on the smallest scale allows smart processes to be developed. The scope is very broad and has already given rise to pioneering results in the development of green and clean processes. The course describes various methods to determine the quantum mechanical electron structure according to first basic principles.

This report estimates that the number of healthy life years lost as a result of neurological disorders will increase from 92 million in 2005 to 103 million in 2030. This increase of around 12% is mainly due to the aging of the population. Notwithstanding the limited number of therapeutic successes, therefore, much importance is still attached to neuroscientific research of the brain both under normal and pathological conditions. Mainly the translational objectives are a driving force for investments in neuroscientific research. Translational neurosciences are defined as: 1 Experimental non-human and non-clinical (basic scientific) studies 1 performed with the specific intention to discover the mechanisms, biomarkers, 1 pathogenesis or treatments for disorders of the nervous system; 2 Clinical studies that provide a basis for the development and testing of 1 new therapeutic strategies for people with disorders of the 1 nervous system. In other words, the translational neurosciences transfer pre-clinical basic knowledge to clinical practice and thereby expand the understanding of brain structure, function and disease, and translate this knowledge into clinical applications and new therapies of disorders of the nervous system. Translational neuroscience includes the process of using all available technological advances to develop new therapies with measurable results for patients with neurological disorders. In this course the emphasis will be on translational neuroimaging, where multiple imaging techniques are used to bridge the gap between preclinical research and clinic practice. These imaging techniques must meet certain criteria such as being non-invasive (MRI), or at least minimally invasive (PET) and must also provide quantitative information that simplifies the translation process from pre-clinical findings to clinical application.', 'content': ''}\n",

In each case, a specific type of theoretical problem is approached on a case study basis, and analytic techniques that are specifically suited to deal with that type of theoretical problem are introduced in the context of the case study. The first problem to be addressed concerns the distribution of specific constructions. The way in which a specific construction, like an existential construction or a particular word order pattern, occurs in actual language use is often co-determined by various factors. It is not just the semantics, i.e. what is being expressed, that determines whether a given construction rather than another surfaces, but also the way in which the discourse is organized or the specific (stylistic or sociolinguistic) features of the text may influence the presence of a construction. The theoretical problem to be solved involves the impact of these various factors grammatical, discursive, sociostylistic: how can one disentangle these ? The relevant quantitative technique that we will introduce is logistic regression. The second problem type involves the relationship between language varieties. When we are confronted with differences in language use of a stylistic, sociolinguistic, geographical nature, we will want to determine which language varieties to distinguish exactly: which stylistic levels, for instance, should we distinguish ? And what are the relations that exist between the different dialects of a language ? The techniques that we will introduce to deal with such questions involve measures of the linguistic distance between language varieties (how close are two varieties with regard to each other ?), and multidimensional scaling methods (how do the varieties cluster together ?) With regard to both problem types, the relevant technical apparatus will be introduced in the form of user-friendly computer tools that ensure that the students may apply the techniques independently.', 'situating': 'Cognitive and functional approaches to linguistics typically take the form of usage-based models of language: they assume that language should not be studied in isolation, but in the context of actual communicative interactions. Methodologically speaking, this implies that corpus linguistics is an important tool for work within the cognitive-functional framework. Methods and techniques for dealing with the large collections of usage data that are found in linguistic corpora are an indispensible part of the equipment of cognitive and functional linguists. In this course, students will become acquainted with the use of corpus techniques in the context of cognitive and functional theory development.

At the end of the semester, two follow up sessions will be planned (on Wednesday December 8 and Wednesday December 15, 2010). First, we start with the presentation of a few motivating examples from statistics that require the optimization of an objective function and/or the approximation of an integral that is analytically not solvable. Examples that will be considered include (not exhaustive): univariate normal model, linear normal regression, the estimation of a proportion, logistic regression, the analysis of contingency tables, a model with gamma-distributed observations, a finite mixture of normals, a mixed model for paired observations, a generalized linear mixed model, a contingency table with incomplete data, bivariate continuous data with missing observations. Second, we will offer some basic tools from multivariate calculus (gradient, Hessian, Taylor series expansion) and from statistics (exponential family).We will define the optimization problem in a formal way and study the necessary and sufficient conditions for its solution. Third, it will be shown that in some cases the optimal parameter estimates can be found directly but in other cases an iterative algorithm is needed. Fourth, some basic methods for iteration-based function optimization will be explained. We start by illustrating methods for the optimization of functions of one variable (bisection, regula falsi, Newton’s method) and then we turn to the optimization of functions of more than one variable. Several frequently used algorithms for multivariate function optimization in a statistical context are presented (e.g., Newton-Raphson, quasi-Newton, steepest descent, downhill simplex, iterative proportional fitting) which differ from each other in the amount of information they use about the surface of the objective function. An alternative to Newton-Raphson that is popular among statisticians, Fisher scoring, will also be studied. The mechanics, advantages and disadvantages of the proposed methods will be illustrated. Because analytical differentiation is not always feasible, we show how numerical differentiation works. Fifth, the course provides an introduction to the field of constrained optimization. The straightforward, but not always applicable, technique of reparameterization will be discussed. An introduction to the theory of Lagrange multipliers will be offered. The connection with shrinkage problems will be made. Sixth, we discuss the relationship between the maximization of the (log)likelihood and statistical inference: asymptotic properties of the MLE, estimates of precision, and testing problems. Seventh, the course covers in detail models that contain an integral that has to be evaluated (linear and generalized linear mixed models). In some cases the integral can be solved analytically but in other cases it has to be approximated numerically. An overview of techniques for numerical integration (e.g., Gaussian quadrature, adaptive Gaussian quadrature, Monte Carlo integration, quasi-Monte Carlo integration) will be given. Eighth, we will introduce the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm which can be applied for incomplete-data problems (where the incompleteness can be genuine or conceptual) to obtain maximum likelihood estimates. By applying the EM algorithm, traditionally difficult estimation problems can become fairly straightforward. The general theory of the EM algorithm will be covered and it will be shown how precision estimates can be obtained from it and how its rate of convergence can be improved upon. A general class of optimization methods, to which the EM algorithm belongs, will be introduced.> /> The estimation of the parameters of a statistical model requires the solution of an optimization problem. In a few simple cases, closed-form solutions exist but for many probability models the optimal parameter estimates have to be determined by means of an iterative algorithm. The goal of this course is threefold. First, we want to offer the participants an overview of some frequently used optimization algorithms in (applied) statistics. Second, we want to provide a framework for understanding the connections among several opmization algorithms as well as between optimization and aspects of statistical inference. Third, some important related topics such as numerical differentiation and integration will be covered. In the first part of the course, we start with the presentation of a few motivating examples from statistics that require the optimization of an objective function. Next, we will define the optimization problem in a formal and abstract way and study the necessary and sufficient conditions for its solution. We also discuss some basic tools for tackling optimization problems from multivariate calculus (gradient, Hessian, Taylor series expansion) and from statistics (exponential family). Then it will be shown that in some cases the optimal parameter estimates can be found directly but in other cases an iterative algorithm is needed. In the second part of the course we will explain some basic methods for iteration-based function optimization. We start by illustrating methods for the optimization of functions of one variable and then we turn to the optimization of functions of more than one variable. Several algorithms are presented (Newton-Raphson, quasi-Newton, conjugate gradient, steepest descent, downhill simplex) which differ from each other in the amount of information they use about the surface of the objective function. The advantages and disadvantages of these methods will be illustrated. Because analytical differentiation is not always feasible, we show how numerical differentiation works. An introduction to the field of constrained optimization will be covered too. In a third part we will apply some of the basic algorithms to the important problem of finding maximum likelihood estimates. In this context, an alternative technique, known as Fisher scoring, is available and its use will be illustrated. Next, we discuss the relationship between the maximization of the (log-)likelihood and statistical inference: asymptotical properties of the MLE, estimates of precision, and testing problems. We also consider the iterative proportional fitting algorithm that can be used in multivariate categorical regression settings. In addition, constrained optimization problems and methods to solve them are discussed. In the fourth part of the course, we present some optimization problems which contain an integral that has to be evaluated (linear and generalized linear mixed models). In some cases the integral can be solved analytically but in other cases it has to be approximated numerically. An overview of techniques for numerical integration will be given.

Of crucial importance is the creation of a relation of trust among scientists and the public. This requires a clear understanding of the aims of science communication, as well as its channels and strategies. The course focuses on the gap between science an the public, in particular in relation to the place of science in public media. Different forms of science communication are related to different intended target audiences. The topics to be treated can be arranged our four general themes. 1. Science in Public This model introduces basic concepts in the understanding of the process of science communication: theories about of definitions and models of science communication, the role of the expert, scientific literacy, the image of science in society. 2. Science and the media Media play an important part in science communication, but, as they are working withintheir proper cultural value system and with speficif formats, they may also be seen as a potential threat to the reliability and accuracy of scientific messages and of the representation of science. Attention is given to the differences and tensions between the cultures of science and journalism. Students will also prepare written expositions on scientific themes. 3. Controversial science and risk communication A special challenge to science communicators is to speak out on themes where no scientific certainty is avalaible, or when the topics are framed in a larger (political) debate. To represent scientific views often merges with a taking of sides, which then may threaten the neutrality of science. This form of communication is often preferred by audiovisual media. Also science blogs tend in this direction. 4. Interactive and participative communication Science in the public sphere has to be viewed as an interactive process, in which the dominating role of the expert cannot be taken for granted. In this form of communication the public takes a central role. This theme focuses on science centres, science cafés, citizen science,... and the approach to disseminate scientific information through informal learning, based on psychological models of leanring. The course analyses the use of interactive and participative communication in different settings.', 'situating': 'The course wants to stimulate reflection on the social meaning of science and the role of communication, information and popularization.

Following this introduction, three-way and multi-way (i.e., multi-dimensional) contingency tables are introduced; also, contemporary statistical notation is introduced at this point, as is the mathematics of probability \"decomposition\" and higher order interactions within multidimensional tables. Logarithms and maximum likelihood estimation are introduced for the log-linear model, followed by the principles of goodness-of-fit testing; alternative methods of hypothesis testing (e.g., chi-square, information criteria) are introduced at this point to permit students to learn alternative approaches to hypothesis testing under varying conditions found in real research settings (e.g., data sparseness, extremely large samples). At this point, substantial emphasis is placed on inference and interpretation of the estimated model parameters. Following the introduction of the log-linear model, attention is turned to models in which one (or more) of the variables is viewed as a dependent variable—the logistic regression model. Substantial attention is given to factors that influence the selection of the appropriate type of logistic model, the proper estimation, and accurate interpretation of parameters estimated under these alternative models. Finally, students are introduced to the logic of models in which one (or more) of the variables is not directly observed—the latent class model. The theory of latent variable modelling is supplemented by multiple examples, so that students can understand the need, and difficulties, associated with estimating, evaluating and interpreting the results of such models. At the end of this segment, students are briefly introduced to some of the most recent developments for latent class models, as well as a brief discussion of possible directions of future research in this area.', 'situating': 'The module on Log-linear and Latent Class Models aims to develop students’ capacity to conduct independent scientific research using advanced techniques of categorical data analysis.

In CTT, the sum score of a person on a set of items is the main focus of interest. The concepts of reliability and validity of this score are discussed and both factor analysis and item analysis are presented as ways to examine the properties of the sum score and its constituent item scores. In IRT, not the individual’s sum score, but the individual’s item scores are the main focus of interest. Depending on the type of item responses (dichotomous or polytomous) and on the different types of predictors included (characteristics of persons, items, or a combination of persons and items) different IRT models emerge. Several of these models are discussed in more detail. Moreover, the proposed framework for IRT-models is related to the field of generalized (non)linear mixed models. Multidimensional Scaling: Multidimensional scaling is an extensive family of models for the spatial or geometrical representation of data and for interpreting their underlying structure and relationships. Its variants allow for a wide variety of data-types at different levels of measurement and uses a range of composition models.

The life table provides a convenient means to introduce the concepts and terminology used in longitudinal analysis: events, risk sets, state space, duration intervals, person-periods, probabilities and transition rates. The life table subsequently shows data on date-of-event-occurrence or age-at-event-occurrence readily encountered in survey material can be converted to longitudinal duration data on event-occurrence. The measurement of duration data is a key element distinguishing different types of event-history analysis. Both discrete-time methods and semi-parametric or continuous-time methods are developed throughout the module. The complexity of event-history analysis is gradually increased throughout the module. The module starts out with the simplest case: the analysis of a non-repeatable event of a single kind (e.g. death, first job…). For discrete-time event-history analysis the model of logistic regression is treated first as it offers a straightforward means of analysing transition probabilities as a function of covariates when used in combination with a person-period file. The logit model of the discrete-time hazard is subsequently compared with models using alternative link functions, such as the complementary log-log link function. The discrete-time models are subsequently compared to parametric methods for continuous-time data and the (semi-parametric) proportional likelihood model introduced by Cox. Following the analysis of non-repeatable events of a single kind, more complex transitions are considered. A research problem that is frequently encountered in the analysis of longitudinal data is the occurrence of multiple kinds of events (eg. death from different causes, differentiation of the entry into the labour market by type of job…). Multinomial logit models are introduced to analyze competing risks in discrete-time. The concept of ‘type-specific hazard functions’ is introduced on the side of continuous-time models. Subsequently, the basic types of event-history analysis discussed for the analysis of events of a single kind and multiple kinds of events are applied in more complicated ways to analyse repeated events and changes of states. Finally, the module considers frailty and shared frailty models in both discrete and continuous-time. Throughout the module, the different types of models are applied to real-world data on the transition to employment among Turkish and Moroccan immigrants in Belgium, data from the National Databank Mortality on socio-economic mortality differentials as well as data on labour force participation and family formation drawn from retrospective surveys such as the Fertility and Family Surveys (FFS), the European Social Survey (ESS) and the Generations and Gender Survey (GGS).', 'situating': 'The module on event-history analysis focuses on the longitudinal analysis of time-to-event data. Longitudinal duration data analysed in this module stem from different research designs, ranging from event-histories collected retrospectively in cross-sectoinal surveys to more complex designs such as panel data including time-varying covariates. The module starts out with basic descriptive methods for the analysis of duration data and subsequently considers generalized linear models such as logistic regression and multinomial logit models to develop discrete-time models for the analysis of time-to-event data. Subsequently, descriptive continuous-time methods are developed (e.g. actuarial life tables and Kaplan-Meier estimates of the survivor function) as well as parametric and semi-parametric methods for the analyses of duration data. Advanced topics in the course include the analysis of competing risks, the analysis of repeated events and the modeling of unobserved heterogeneity in hazard models.', 'semester': '1', 'lecturer': 'Neels Karel', 'credits': '6', 'study_time': '180.0', 'contact_hours': '30 ', 'language': 'EN'}\n",

On a \\'macro scale\\' the desired shape change is obtained and on a \\'micro scale\\' the microstructure of the material is changed. This microstructure is related to the mechanical and physical properties of the metal and is heavily dependent of some external parameters like temperature, strain, strain rate, deformation mode, lubricants, etc. The blacksmith in ancient times was mainly concerned with the macroscopic shape change, but the modern metal industry requires thermo-mechanical processes that lead to a product with optimal properties, not only concerning dimensional precision and appearance, but also concerning mechanical and physical properties. The aim of the present course is to give an overview of the main manufacturing processes but also to provide some understanding of the complicated relations between a forming process and the microstructure of a metal on one hand and between this microstructure and the mechanical properties on the other hand. In part I of this course (\\'Science\\') some more theoretical aspects are treated. It is assumed that the student has already acquired some basic knowledge of elasticity and plasticity theory and of physical metallurgy. This knowledge will be further developed, focussed on phenomena that occur during or are related to deformation (strengthening, substructure development, recrystallisation, crystallographic textures, residual stresses, friction, etc.) In part II of this course (\\'Technology\\') the most important metal forming operations are described. This part is mainly focussed on the \\'macro scale\\' (shaping a metallic part) although also here some connections with the microstructure will be made. For example in the chapter about \\'sheet metal forming\\' the main issue is the relation between material properties (e.g. plastic anisotropy) and formability. The third part of this course (\"case studies\") is devoted to the \\'micro scale\\'. In a number of case studies the thermo-mechanical processing of some products is analysed and discussed. The examples show how properties can be optimised by a careful control of the microstructure during processing.', 'situating': 'The aim of the present course is to give an overview of the main metal forming processes and to provide some understanding of the complicated relations between a forming process and the microstructure of a metal on the one hand and between this microstructure and the mechanical properties on the other hand.

Special attention is given to the sintering, which forms the basis of the powder technology for the production of materials. Ceramics distinguish themselves from metals and polymers by means of their mechanical behaviour, especially their brittleness. Therefore, special attention will go to the following aspects: basic concepts of fracture mechanics, strength of ceramics at low and high temperatures, the concept of fracture toughness, ceramic composites, thermal stresses, Weibull-statistics, subcritical crack growth, and mechanical testing of ceramics.

This part introduces class diagrams as a way to capture the overall structure of a software system. It further studies how to specify, implement and verify uni-directional associations and bi-directional associations. It also covers the lifecycle of objects, and introduces destructors as a concept to explicitly destroy them. \\u2028\\u2028 3. Inheritance The final part of the course focuses on the development of hierarchies of classes. This part studies single inheritance as a mechanism to define a new class as an extension, respectively as a specialization of an existing class. It complements that study with polymorphism and dynamic binding, and shows how these concepts contribute to the adaptability and re-usability of software systems. The part also includes an in-depth study of the Liskov substitution principle.', 'situating': 'In-depth study of a structured and disciplined approach to develop medium-sized, sequential software systems using the paradigm of object oriented programming.

The goal of data mining is to fill this void by automatically identify models and patterns from these databases that are (1) valid, that is, they hold on new data with some certainty, (2) novel, that is, they are non-obvious, (3) useful, that is, they are actionable, and (4) understandable. that is humans can interpret them. In order to do this, data mining, also called knowledge discovery in databases (KDD), combines ideas from the fields of machine learning, databases, statistics, visualization, and many other fields. The goal of this course is to provide a broad survey of several important and well-know fields of data mining and to develop an overall sense of how to extract information from data in a systematic way. It tries to give inisght into the challenges faced by data miners and the inner workers of specific data mining algorithms as well as provide some understanding about why data mining is important and interesting.

Actively striving to introduce “innovation” in a company is a very important attitude that the course wants to stimulate, with the design deliverable as the main outcome. Objective 2 Within the very broad context of “embedded systems”, the course puts strong emphasis on: the systems-level thinking: every part of the system is selected and tuned for the goals of the whole system. innovative design : comparison of possible alternatives should be done on the basis of informed and motivated argumentations, and each design should clearly identify why it is “better” than what exists already. design automation : what standards and tools exist to support the design in large-scale projects, in which no single person can keep the overview and control of the whole design process . Objective 3 The concrete contents of the course are detailed during the first lectures, in dialogue with the students. Indeed, students are expected to have a strong influence on these concrete course contents, since this is a perfect example of how, in their future professional live, they will be responsible for their company's initiatives, innovation and realisations!

Zijm, 2005): Skilled in research : students are taught how to do research, that is, how to explore and structure new domains of knowledge in a systematic and goal-oriented way. Scientific approach : the learning takes place via the formulation and motivation of hypotheses and models to explain the working of the “world”, and the consequent corroboration or refutation of those hypotheses via confrontation with the factual reality and/or the input from more experienced peers.

The course covers general theoretical aspects for reliability prediction, analysis, verification and optimization in mechanical engineering: 1. General introduction to reliability: identification of factors that are important for reliability analysis 2.

Fatigue and life time prediction: stress based fatigue analysis, strain based approach, damage tolerant design based on linear fracture mechanics and crack propagation', 'situating': 'Motivation In current mechanical engineering practice, where we are constantly striving for more energy efficient and thus lighter, optimised products, safety margins become more and more narrow. In this context, reliability is becoming a critical aspect, that requires attention from the earliest design phase until the end-of-life of a product. Rendering failure impossible might seem as the ultimate goal when designing new products. Don’t we all want to fly an airplane that simply cannot crash? Or build nuclear plants that can withstand any earthquake? Unfortunately, it is not the binary principle of failure (im)possibility that determines the acceptability of a design. Since neither the eventually produced product nor its environment can be predicted in a deterministic sense, it is all about probability. Keeping that probability of failure at an acceptable level, has become one of the key challenges for engineers today. Course objectives The objective of this course is to provide students with a general overview of different aspects of reliability in current mechanical engineering practice. The students gain insight in the typical methodologies for reliability prediction, analysis, verification and optimization. Apart from the methods, they also gain insight in the typical causes of mechanical failure. Furthermore, since the short life cycle of many mechanical products complicates the use of field data and prototype testing in reliability assessment, reliability becomes more and more a critical aspect that needs to be integrated in the design from the earliest phases of the design process. After successful completion of this course, the student will have insight in and knows how to apply modern methods that are used to predict and verify reliability in this context. Lectures learning outcomes After successful completion of this course, the student has proven to know and understand the meaning of standard terminology in reliability analysis techniques. He is able to select specific distribution types for different classes of reliability problems, and to apply probability theory on these in order to perform the time dependent reliability analysis of mechanical components. He is able to analyze testing data with respect to the lifetime of a mechanical component, and to transform this information into standard distributions that serve as input for the reliability assessment on the system level. He is able to quantify the reliability of a complex built-up mechanical system, starting from the analysis on the component level, using quantitative techniques. He can apply Markov process modeling for time dependent reliability assessment of systems including repair and maintenance. He is able to describe the main properties of qualitative and semi-quantitative techniques for system analysis, to apply the principles of these methodologies on basic problems, and to critically assess their value in a mechanical engineering context. In the framework of fatigue analysis, the student can derive and interpret typical material properties for stress-based approaches, he has insight into the sensitivity of these properties with respect to operational conditions, and is able to apply the stress-based approach for the assessment of the lifetime of a mechanical component that is under regular and irregular time dependent loading, for uni-axial as well as multi-axial stress conditions. The student further knows how stress-based analysis can be extended to the strain-based approach, he can derive and knows how to interpret the corresponding material properties, and knows when and how to apply this technique for the assessment of the lifetime of a mechanical component. The student understands the basic principles of damage tolerant design, and knows how to apply the theoretical principles of linear fracture mechanics in this context. Finally, the student knows how to apply the principles of strength-load interference in the context of mechanical design. He has insight in the meaning of the concept ‘reliability index’ and knows how this concept can be generalized in a more generic mechanical design context with multiple design parameters. Also, he knows how reliability can be integrated in a design based on numerical simulation techniques. in this context, he knows the principles of analytical as well as sampling strategies to estimate the reliability index, and can critically assess the application of these approaches for a specific design problem. He knows how these approaches can be integrated in a framework of reliability based design optimization. Seminars learning outcomes After successful completion of the seminars, the student is able to determine the reliability of a design, starting from a deterministic numerical model and the definition of the variability on this model. He knows how to apply both analytical as well as sampling strategies, and can derive appropriate surrogate models for this purpose. The student is able to set up and perform an analysis that leads to a reliable and robust design, and has insight in the different steps involved in the procedure.', 'semester': '2', 'lecturer': 'Moens David', 'credits': '3', 'study_time': '90.0', 'contact_hours': '20 ', 'language': 'EN'}\n",

The lab sessions are 2.5 hours.', 'situating': '„» Digital communication is widely taught in electrical engineering programs. This is no surprise—the mathematical theory of digital communication is beautiful and elegant. There has been a growing separation, however, in the abstract content of a typical course and what is implemented in practice. This difference is particularly evident in wireless communication systems, which have their own set of specific challenges, non-idealities, and hardware constraints. As a byproduct of the growing rift between theory and practice, and the increasing reliance on simulation, many students are not prepared to apply their abstract knowledge in a real digital wireless communication system. In this lab you will learn how to design and implement a wireless communication solution. Using a software defined radio platform, you will first learn how to program a simple wireless packet transmitter and receiver and get practical experience with various aspects related to wireless communication. This includes for instance channel coding, modulation and demodulation, timing recovery and forward error correction. When the wireless link is up and running, one of two possible extension will be considered.

Part II: System integration Electronic systems fabrication can be viewed as an assembly and packaging of a number of components. For today’s advanced systems, the typical components are complex integrated circuits (so called Silicon chips), that are studied in Part II of this course. However, for the system to be optimally performing, the “assembly” techniques are crucial, and with the advancement of the performance of the IC, also different and more complex assembly techniques have been developed to match ultimate system requirements.

In biomedical data processing, the aim is to extract clinically, biochemically or pharmaceutically relevant information (e.g rhythms or spikes) in terms of parameters out of low-quality measurements in order to enable an improved medical diagnosis. Typically, biomedical data are affected by large measurement errors, largely due to the noninvasive nature of the measurement process or the severe constraints to keep the input signal as low as possible for safety and bio-ethical reasons. Accurate and automated quantification of this information requires an ingenious combination of the following 4 issues: an adequate pretreatment of the data, the design of an appropriate model and model validation, a fast and numerically robust model parameter quantification method, and an extensive evaluation study, using in-vivo and patient data, up to the embedding of the advanced tools into userfriendly user interfaces to be used by clinicians. To solve each of the above issues, special attention is given to the design of improved models and the development of advanced algorithms, as mentioned above, for processing multichannel biomedical data, possibly acquired using various modalities (e.g. EEG and fMRI). Continuing on the course ``H03I2A Biomedical Data Processing'', the following advanced topics are discussed in 13 two-hour lectures and one 4-hour workshop: Introduction (2x2h): including an overview of basic data processing tools such as Singular Value Decomposition, total least squares fitting, Correlation analysis, principal component analysis, etc. Subspace based signal processing (1x2h): including harmonic retrieval, signal enhancement, canonical correlation analysis.

This course starts from the reality that such systems are developed from an evolving context: starting from existing and related systems, with attention to reuse within different applications, and based on components that are supplied by independent, third-party providers and vendors. Students will acquire understanding, experience with and skills that are important to develop, realize, evaluate and extend the architecture of a software-intensive system. The course starts with functional and especially non-functional requirements that have a strong impact on the software architecture, and includes techniques and notations to document such requirements.', 'semester': '2', 'lecturer': 'Joosen Wouter', 'credits': '4', 'study_time': '120.0', 'contact_hours': '24 ', 'language': 'EN'}\n",

In the new course (7.5 points) the amount of material is increased, especially regarding LC applications. The experimental part is significantly expanded through a lab-project, in which the students in depth study individually choosen subjects within the frame of the course. Most people are familiar with the fact that matter can exist in three different states: solid, liquid and gas. However, this is a simplification, and under extreme conditions other forms of matter can exist, e.g. plasma at very high temperatures or superfluid helium at very low temperatures. But we do not have to go to these extreme conditions to find new forms of order in matter. In liquid crystals, which are anisotropic fluids, the molecular order lies between those of the isotropic liquid and the crystal and the classification of liquid crystals is based on their degrees of orientational and positional order. From a basic physics point of view these materials are of large interest and have contributed to the modern understanding of phase transitions and critical phenomena, and to the knowledge about order phenomena in one, two, and three dimensions. To common people liquid crystals are today almost synonomous to flat panel displays (Liquid Crystal Displays, LCDs) for TVs, computers, mobile phones, and other electronic equipment. But there is also a rapid development of other types of application, for instance in telecommunication, pattern recognition, real time holography, non-mechanical beam steering etc. Liquid crystals consitute a unique form of soft matter and are becoming more and more important also in pure materials science in the development of polymer materials and biomaterials. The existence of life is directly dependent on self-organizing soft matter and here liquid crystalline systems are very important. One example is our cell membranes which consist of so-called lyotropic liquid crystals. The course will give a basic understanding of the physics and different applications of liquid crystals. The content ranges from the history of liquid crystal science, from the first observations in the late nineteenth century, via the development of theories of the liquid crystalline state, the development of liquid crystal displays and examples of today s state of the art research. After about 30 years of strong focus on liquid crystal displays, a large part of the liquid crystal research is today shifting towards nanoscience, colloidal systems, biological systems and, on the applicational side, towards photonics and microwave electronics. The course will stress on how knowledge in optics, thermodynamics, electromagnetism, vector analysis, symmetry analysis, etc. constitutes the basis for the very rapid development of liquid crystal displays and devices that we use every day. Furthermore, the course will through laboratory projects and demonstrations give an introduction to the manufacturing of liquid crystal displays. 1.

More information: https://www.student.chalmers.se/sp/course?course_id=23684 Microelectronics is presently entering the era of nanoelectronics. The scaling down of microprocessors to \"nanoprocessors\" will eventually require entirely new computer architectures and computational concepts. One will have to address questions like: how small can programmable logic gates become; can they be made from nanoscale devices other than conventional transistors; can other types of nanoscale structures be used as computer devices? Also, there are well defined limits on what up to date technology for producing electronic components can achieve. In this context, the question is whether we need to develop new ways of computing, e.g. try to mix artificial nanostructures with organic molecules and biomolecules, and even artificial and living cells and other biological matter. If these systems can be made selfassembling, then it might be possible to construct evolvable hardware and selfassembling computer devices. To this, one can add computational systems based on chemical and biological reactions and artificial and living neural networks and brains. The course aims at describing current trends and future expectations concerning systems and \"hardware\" for information processing. Following topics are discussed: (1) The present development of Nanoelectronics, Molecular electronics and Bioelectronics, and the consequences for functionality and computational schemes; (2) fundamental physical limitations of computational devices and schemes; (3) development of different computer architectures like reconfigurable computers, reversible and quantum computers, cellular automata, neural networks, brains, and biochemical computing. Improvement of existing CMOS technology will eventually be impossible due to either fundamental or economic limits. In order to continue the miniaturization and performance increase of information processing devices, alternative architectures, materials, assembling techniques and models for information processing are currently explored in various research activities.

The purpose of this course is to learn the basic principles of this theory, and then apply them to field tensors (stress, strain, electrical field, ...) and to material properties described by 'matter tensors' of rank 1, 2, 3 and 4. In spite of the fact that this approach does not make (explicit) use of the discrete nature of matter (which explains the term 'continuum modelling'), it allows for some very important and useful conclusions as for the relationship between the anisotropy of material properties and the crystal symmetry (or other types of symmetry) of the material. A few important applications are shortly introduced as an illustration of the method, namely the theory of elasticity, the finite element method and an introduction to the classical mathematical theory of plasticity.\", 'situating': 'The students are familiar with the transformation properties of tensorial quantities and have an active, operational knowledge of vector and tensor calculus.

In addition to genetics, the health of individuals is controlled by external and environmental factors, which influence cell metabolism and introduce mutations that lead to numerous diseases such as cancer and allergies or promote healthy states such as caused by pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals. Numerous products in common, everyday use are either formulated to specifically influence human health or have an incidental effect. Chemical engineers have an active role in health and well-being creation. In this course, we focus on a chemical engineering perspective of health and how a chemical engineer can create new solutions to current challenges to human health. We aim to motivate the students to think outside of the box and with focus on building bridges of multi and interdisciplinarity. Moreover, we address challenges and opportunities for chemical engineering for health that are of high relevance for the booming cluster of life sciences in Flanders and in Europe.

After an introduction to the domain specific terminology and the legal framework, pretreatment (i.e., primary) techniques are introduced, i.e., screening and the removal of non soluble, non biodegradable components (sand, fat and oil). Subsequently, techniques for biological wastewater treatment (i.e., the secondary techniques) are detailed. The focus lies on activated sludge systems since they are the most representative biologically based treatment systems. Traditionally such a system comprises reactors for biodegradation and sedimentation. In the biodegradation tanks, a mixture of predominantly bacteria (the so called activated sludge) breaks down the polluting components in the wastewater in a sequence of anaerobic, anoxic and/or aerobic tanks. Carbon, as well as nitrogen and phosphorus removal is explained, all of them from a biological as well as a modeling/design view point. To accomplish the separation of the purified water from the activated sludge, gravitation is exploited in the sedimentation tanks. Both the physical concepts behind and the state-of-the-art sedimentation models are introduced. As for (waste) activated sludge treatment, anaerobic sludge digestion passes in review. Furthermore, more recent trends and problems such as integrated ways to remove nitrogen and sludge sedimentation failures are discussed. Whenever possible, guest lectures are organized to ensure an up-to-date vision on the currently implemented practices. As for the tertiary techniques, special attention is devoted to physicochemical techniques like adsorption, pressure drive membrane techniques and membrane bioreactors, neutralization, precipitation methods, ion exchange and disinfection. For each technique it is indicated which water quality can be reached. On the basis of the introduced tertiary techniques, the avenues for water reuse are explored.

These relatively small exercises aim to refresh the basic concepts of the different disciplines. The student can improve his/her knowledge on each discipline whenever necessary. Part 2: Combination of disciplines in stationary problems (approximately 25 contact hours): The second part focusses on stationary problems that require the combination of different disciplines to find a solution. Problems may lack data, requiring an order of magnitude estimation of missing parameters. At the same time, some data can be redundant or unnecessary. Part 3: Combination of disciplines in transient problems (approximately 25 contact hours): Part 3 adds the transient behavior to the type of problems handled in part 2. These dynamic problems are often governed by differential equations which must be solved.

What aspects of the problem are negligible? What time constants determine the response of the system and how are these treated? How can a complex system be split up into sub-problems and how can it be described in a sufficiently accurate mathematical way?

The change it requires it not just a technical improvement of the current system, but indeed a complete overhaul of the current energy system. Such a change cannot happen in the realm of technology alone, nor can it be solved in a laboratory. Changes will be needed at different levels, will be technical, social, legal, organisational, regulatory, etc.,etc. in character, and will be coupled with each other. Such combinations of system changes are called \\'transitions\\'. Although there is a lot of talking about transitions and even \\'transition management\\', a fundamental understanding of processes of technical and societal (i.e. socio-technical) change is often lacking among those involved in these processes. This course aims to provide more insight in these issues and is aimed at those students that want to and will be involved in it. In addition students will also learn some skills how to analyse and act within transition processes. To understand processes of scientific and technological change the course will start with some basic history and philosophy of science. The view of the world as put forward by Plato and Aristoteles was seen as a true account of reality for about 2000 years, until the Scientific Revolution in Europe put another model forward. The basic differences between the two models will be highlighted, but also the more philosophical difficulties that remained, despite the obvious succes of the new Modern model. Even after more than 350 years of successes of modern science, these discussions have led to different perceptions on how to interpret reality, varying from a Baconian radical positivism (Wiener Kreis), via moderate neo-positivism (Karl Popper) and historic paradigm-based thinking (Thomas Kuhn) to almost relativistic constructivism (Bruno Latour). An important shift in these discussions has been that, instead of just defining general principles for \\'good science\\' and applying them in theoretical essays, science and technology philosophers started to look at historical cases (the \\'historical turn\\') and finally by setting up their own contemporary research (\\'empirical turn\\'). This was the basis for what we call today \"Science and Technology Studies (STS)\", i.e. the study of how science and technology change by studying specific cases using very detailed anthropological and historical research tools. More and more STS studies were combined with insights from new directions in Economics research, such as evolutionary economics and industrial economics. The main findings and discussions of these studies will be summarised in the course. About 10 years ago academics started to wonder how all these insights could help society to pursue transitions that are desired, such as a transition towards a sustainable energy system. They came up with a model, which is a pragmatic mixture of very differents schools of thought. This model is called \\'Transition Management\\'. During the last 10 years this model has been developed further and several tools and subtools for transition management have been developed. We will look at the basics of the model and try to see (in student groups) if we can frame historical cases in this model. Then we will start looking at the need for a transition towards a sustainable energy system and define subcases of this transition to be worked out by the students in the groups. An oral examination over all the material of the course, together with the written preparatory notes of each student will define each individual\\'s student rating.', 'situating': 'At the end of the course students will have acquired new insights and new skills . The insights will be based on a focused understanding of basic philosophy of science concepts and how these lead to modern day transition theory . This transition theory will be applied to cases focused on the future transition towards a more sustainable energy system.', 'semester': '1', 'credits': '3', 'study_time': '90.0', 'contact_hours': '23 ', 'language': 'EN'}\n",

We will explain the various types of privacy risks and introduce a range of existing privacy technologies that address these risks. These include: cryptographic protocols with applications to privacy, including: private information retrieval, oblivious transfer, anonymous e-cash, anonymous authentication, and private search. communication privacy , including: anonymous communication systems, censorship resistant communications, and traffic analysis methods and attacks. database privacy , including: k-anonymization, de-anonymization algorithms, and differential privacy. privacy in social networks , including: protection of shared content, protection of user interactions, and tools for assistance with privacy relevant decision-making. location privacy , including: space-temporal cloaking, mix zones, and privacy-preserving access to location-based services.', 'situating': 'Here are three reasons why you might want to take this course: First , as engineer you will be designing, implementing, or managing electronic systems and services that in most cases have privacy implications. For example, ambient sensors and biomedical implants collect, process, store, and communicate (sometimes highly sensitive) data related to individuals; the data generated by ubiquitous electronic communications provides detailed insight into people’s activities and lifestyle; and the personalization of multimedia applications and services relies on learning about individuals’ most intimate preferences and adapting to them. The first objective ( O1 ) of the course is that you are able to identify the privacy concerns that arise in different scenarios. For example, if you are designing a new video-on-demand service for mobile phones, what could go wrong for your future users’ privacy? The second objective ( O2 ) is that you are able to relate privacy concerns to technical design choices . For example, what privacy risks arise from relying on unique identifiers? or from centralizing the storage and processing of data? Privacy technologies aim to mitigate privacy concerns. The third objective ( O3 ) is that you understand the principles underlying the design of privacy technologies . For example, anonymity technologies require diversity (of users, uses, attributes, internet subnets, etc.); advanced cryptographic protocols enable sophisticated services (e.g., smart metering) while minimizing the disclosure of data beyond what seems intuitively possible; and differential privacy ensures that queries to database of personal records cannot be used to determine if a particular individual record is included in the database. Most of the privacy technologies covered in the course are designed following security engineering principles. A necessary part of security engineering is the security evaluation of the system. This involves defining the adversary model and devising attack strategies. The fourth objective ( O4 ) is thus that you are able to analyze privacy technologies and evaluate their vulnerabilities with respect to different adversary models . For example, how can an anonymized social graph be re-identified? To what extent do anonymous communication services (such as Tor) provide you with anonymity for browsing the web? Can your encrypted Skype conversation be reconstructed through traffic analysis? Second , you will deal with privacy issues not only as an engineer but also as an individual and as a member of society. As an individual, you use a variety of services: mobile communications, online shopping, search engines such as Google, social media such as Facebook or Twitter, etc. The fifth objective of this course ( O5 ) is that you become aware of what privacy issues are associated to the use of different services, what are your basic (legal) rights concerning privacy and data protection, and what technologies you can use to mitigate your exposure to privacy risks. As a result of this, you will be able to form your own informed opinions on how privacy issues should be addressed in our increasingly technological society. Many of these privacy issues are at the heart of ongoing debates whose outcome will have an influence on how society is shaped: Is the tracking of Internet users necessary for the economic sustainability of the Internet? Might profiling and personalization lead to social sorting and discrimination? Should certain content be censored? Should user communications be stored for long periods of time for the purpose of law-enforcement investigations? Are we building an unprecedented mass surveillance infrastructure, or are overblown privacy concerns an obstacle to data-driven innovation? Finally , the course is heavily based on recent research. By participating in this course you will get a first hand experience of what research is like . The sixth objective ( O6 ) is that you learn to read, critically review, and present scientific articles .', 'semester': '1', 'lecturer': 'Diaz Martinez Maria Claudia', 'credits': '3', 'study_time': '90.0', 'contact_hours': '14 ', 'language': 'EN'}\n",

From the electronic structure of free atoms, the students will be able to explain the structure of the Mendeliev Table and the 'how and why' of periodically varying atomic characteristics. Based on the atomic characteristics students are able to understand the various type of bonds in chemical compounds. Based on the macroscopic behaviour and the qualities of types of substances and compounds (stability, stoechiometry, geometry and reactivity) students will be able to distinguish intermolecular interaction vis-à-vis intramolecular energetics. The preceding discussion finally allows the students to derive physical and chemical qualities of a few important families of compounds logically to a certain degree, which ultimately explains the behaviour of these compounds in chemical, material-engineering and electrotechnical applications.\", 'semester': '1', 'lecturer': 'Seefeldt Marc', 'credits': '3', 'study_time': '90.0', 'contact_hours': '20 ', 'language': 'EN'}\n",

They should be able to motivate the choice for the formal system or the form of inference. Global advantages and disadvantages of the techniques are known and have to be used in this choice. The connections and differences between the different languages are understood. Students are capable of recognizing the relevant concepts in a problem domain and to design a logical vocabulary for them. They can distinguish not only explicit but also implicit information in a problem setting and can express both types of information in the logics of this course, or they can evaluate whether these logics are suitable for expressing these. They can analyze tasks and problems and classify them as formal logic inference tasks. They are capable of specifying these inference tasks in a concrete way and let them solve by a suitable inference tool. The students are familiar with a number of static information concepts such as enumeration, sufficient and necessary conditions, inductive definitions, unique name propositions, domain closure propositions. They are familiar with information concepts in the context of dynamic systems such as inertia, pre and postconditions, state formulas and invariants, causal rules, and with process properties including fairness, deadlock, aliveness, reachability. They have an understanding of modelling at different levels of abstraction and of the refinement principle to connect these different levels of abstraction. The students are also familiar with fundamental logical concepts such as model semantics, logical entailment, satisfiability, logical equivalence, contradiction. They know fundamental results and what they mean, such as the incompleteness theorem of Goedel, expressiveness limitations and the undecidability of classical logic and extensions.

For the joining of materials (being equal or not) different techniques have been developed over the years and welding is the far mostly used technique. After this course, students have an overview of all possible joining techniques and detailed knowledge on the commonly used ones. They are aware of the most important phenomena and the pro's and contra's. Special attention is paid to new techniques such as laser welding, friction stir welding, etc. The course is given in modules. Each module handles a specific area of the joining technology. Five modules are given. Two modules are fixed in topic (weldability and design of welded constructions), and three modules are defined in negotiation with the students.\", 'semester': '1', 'lecturer': 'Froyen Ludo', 'credits': '6', 'study_time': '180.0', 'contact_hours': '46 ', 'language': 'EN'}\n",

The student is able to describe, explain and use different discretization techniques, namely: Finite differences (FD); Finite volumes (FV); Finite elements (FE). Moreover he/she can perform a critical analysis of these discretisation methods in terms of accuracy, stability and convergence. The student understands and can discuss the potential and limitations of methods for numerical analysis. The student is able to give an overview of Computational fluid dynamic (CFD) techniques for the simulation of turbulence flows; Computational electromagnetic (EM) techniques for the simulation of electromagnetic problems. From the practical point of view, the student is able to Implement the numerical discretization of simple 1D and 2D problems in fluid dynamics and electromagnetism, simulate and analyse them. Evaluate, choose and use specific software packages (either commercial or open source), based on e.g. FV for CFD or FE for EM, to handle real-live applications. He/she understands the possible choices and approximations available in this kind of software. Analyze and assess the reliability of his own results. At the end of the course the student will also have a general knowledge of modelling, simulation and design techniques in fluid dynamics and electromagnetism.', 'semester': '1', 'lecturer': 'Vazquez Sabariego Ruth', 'credits': '6', 'study_time': '180.0', 'contact_hours': '13 ', 'language': 'EN'}\n",

Each chapter begins by posing a problem, immediately followed by a number of illustrations of the problem with practical examples and the matching signals. Next, signal processing, modelling or analysis techniques will be discussed: firstly, the relatively simple handbook methods, followed by more advanced approaches specified to the issue at hand. Each chapter is concluded with multiple applications on important and practical problems. Chapter 1. The course starts with an illustrated introduction to human health signals. Chapter 2 is also introductory, but puts the emphasis on the analysis of multiple linked and correlated signals. Chapter 3 exclusively deals with filtering to delete artefacts, an important pre-processing step for the actual signal analysis. By means of a great number of illustrations the effect of different filtering techniques will be discussed. Chapter 4 presents techniques that are especially useful for detection of events in human health signals. Chapter 5 focuses on the analysis of the wave form and wave form complexity of events and signal components. Chapter 6 discusses frequency domain techniques for the characterization of human health signals and systems. Chapter 7 treats modelling of human health signals and systems, enabling a parametrical representation and analysis. Chapter 8 deals with the analysis of non-stationary signals. Chapter 9 focuses on pattern recognition and diagnostic decisions in human health systems. An introductory overview will be given on linear and non-linear pattern recognition techniques. Chapter 10 introduces wavelet analysis (transformations, decomposition), a technique which is particularly useful in monitoring nonstationary human health signals and systems and has gained a lot in popularity. A wavelet decomposition allows to decompose a signal into subcomponents with different resolutions. Chapter 11 focuses on multichannel signal processing, i.e. the analysis of signals recorded on multiple channels (e.g. spatially different sites). Especially Principal and Independent Components Analysis, which allow to split the multichannel signals into separate source signals (such as muscle artefacts, ECG, breathing...), will be discussed.

If you enroll in the course “European seminar on Quantitative psychology”, you may participate in the Intensive Programme. The rationale and objectives of the European seminar are three-fold. (1) In the psychological sciences, many models and theories have been communicated verbally and implicitly. This leads to interpretations that do not permit rigorous testing and falsification hampering communication and progress within as well as across disciplines. Mathematical and computational models on the other hand provide precise qualitative and quantitative predictions offering a rich background for empirical investigations and applications. (2) There is a continuing trend in the psychological sciences to use new and sophisticated research technologies (e.g., dynamical systems theory, Bayesian statistics and model selection, brain imaging). These technological advances are quickly changing how research is conducted and how theoretical models are formulated and tested. These developments also bring about significant changes in the way students need to be taught. (3) There is a need for better understanding of computational models and better training in new research methods and techniques.

The social, cultural, economic and political trajectories of many cities in the Global South have often developed along completely different historical lines than those of cities in Europe and the West. Very often, cities in the South are depicted as problematic or even pathological entities compared to Northern cities, and are assumed to be solely marked by lack, decay, scarcity and marginalisation, by increasing poverty and de-industrialisation, by violence and breakdown, or by an increasing lack of space and an ever-growing demographic density. Although to some extent this might be true, using the words 'poverty', 'violence,' 'slum,' and so on, has also made invisible the everyday practices and experiences of urban dwellers, the concrete content of urban life as lived on a daily basis. These specific urban worlds often remain “shadow cities” (Neuwirth 2006), whose inhabitants are reduced to a sort of invisible “excess humanity” (Davis 2006), and whose capacity to negotiate conditions of scarcity, exclusion and/or poverty is ignored. To investigate these issues, renowned architects, urban planners, anthropologists, geographers, artists, sociologists and engineers will share their alternative readings of these particular urban spaces. Their presentations will acknowledge both the tensions and conflicts at work in such sites, as well as the opportunities that are generated thanks to or in spite of them. They will also pay attention to the specific ways in which civil society’s and city dwellers’ ‘agency’ is enabled or disabled in such urban environments.
